Penetration testing (or **pen testing**) is a security testing process where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a system, application, or network to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. It helps organizations assess their security posture and fix weaknesses.

### **Types of Penetration Testing:**
1. **Black Box Testing** – Testers have no prior knowledge of the system.
2. **White Box Testing** – Testers have full knowledge of the system, including source code and architecture.
3. **Gray Box Testing** – Testers have partial knowledge, like access credentials but not complete system details.

### **Penetration Testing Process:**
1. **Planning & Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target system.
2. **Scanning** – Identifying open ports, services, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation** – Actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Assessing the impact of an attack.
5. **Reporting** – Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

### **Tools Used in Penetration Testing:**
- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Nmap**
- **Wireshark**

## Virtual box

VirtualBox is a free and open-source **virtualization software** developed by **Oracle** that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. It creates **virtual machines (VMs)** that act like separate computers, enabling you to install and run different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, without affecting your main operating system.

### **Key Features of VirtualBox:**

1. **Cross-Platform Support** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
2. **Multiple OS Installation** – Run different OSs simultaneously on the same machine.
3. **Snapshot Feature** – Save the state of a VM and revert back if needed.
4. **Seamless Mode** – Integrates guest and host OS interfaces.
5. **Shared Folders & Clipboard** – Enables file sharing between host and guest OS.
6. **USB Device Support** – Connect and use USB devices inside the VM.

### **Why Use VirtualBox?**

- **Software Testing** – Run and test applications on different OSs.
- **Safe Experimentation** – Try new software without affecting your main OS.
- **Learning & Development** – Practice Linux or other OS environments without dual booting.

## Linux

### **What is Linux?**  

Linux is an **open-source, Unix-like operating system** that powers everything from personal computers to servers, smartphones, and even supercomputers. It is known for its **stability, security, and flexibility** and is widely used in software development, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.

### **Key Features of Linux:**

1. **Open Source** – Free to use, modify, and distribute.
2. **Multi-User & Multi-Tasking** – Supports multiple users and tasks at the same time.
3. **Highly Secure** – Fewer vulnerabilities compared to Windows.
4. **Customizable** – Can be modified according to user needs.
5. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Powerful for automation and scripting.
6. **Lightweight & Efficient** – Runs well on old hardware.

### **Popular Linux Distributions (Distros):**

- **Ubuntu** – Beginner-friendly, widely used for desktops and servers.
- **Debian** – Stable and used as a base for many other distros.
- **Fedora** – Cutting-edge features and updates.
- **Kali Linux** – Specialized for penetration testing and cybersecurity.
- **Arch Linux** – Lightweight and fully customizable for advanced users.

### **Where is Linux Used?**

- **Servers** (e.g., Google, Facebook, Amazon run on Linux)
- **Supercomputers**
- **Cloud Computing & DevOps**
- **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking**
- **Embedded Systems** (Smart TVs, routers, IoT devices)

## **Why is Kali Linux Used for Penetration Testing?**  

Kali Linux is a **Debian-based Linux distribution** specifically designed for **penetration testing, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity research**. It comes pre-installed with hundreds of **penetration testing tools**, making it a powerful choice for security professionals.

### **Key Reasons for Using Kali Linux in Penetration Testing:**

1. **Pre-Installed Hacking & Security Tools** 🛠️  
   - Kali includes **600+ security tools** for ethical hacking, including:  
     - **Nmap** (network scanning)  
     - **Metasploit** (exploiting vulnerabilities)  
     - **Wireshark** (packet analysis)  
     - **John the Ripper** (password cracking)  
     - **Aircrack-ng** (WiFi hacking)  
   
2. **Root User by Default (Previously)** 🔑  
   - Earlier versions of Kali Linux operated as **root (admin) by default**, allowing unrestricted access to system resources. (Recent versions have introduced a standard user for security reasons.)

3. **Lightweight & Customizable** 🏆  
   - Kali is optimized for **low-resource environments** and can be customized to include only the necessary tools.

4. **Rolling Release Updates** 🔄  
   - Kali gets **frequent updates** with the latest security tools and exploits.
