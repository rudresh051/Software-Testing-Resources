Penetration testing (or **pen testing**) is a security testing process where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a system, application, or network to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. It helps organizations assess their security posture and fix weaknesses.

### **Types of Penetration Testing:**
1. **Black Box Testing** â€“ Testers have no prior knowledge of the system.
2. **White Box Testing** â€“ Testers have full knowledge of the system, including source code and architecture.
3. **Gray Box Testing** â€“ Testers have partial knowledge, like access credentials but not complete system details.

### **Penetration Testing Process:**
1. **Planning & Reconnaissance** â€“ Gathering information about the target system.
2. **Scanning** â€“ Identifying open ports, services, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation** â€“ Actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation** â€“ Assessing the impact of an attack.
5. **Reporting** â€“ Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

### **Tools Used in Penetration Testing:**
- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Nmap**
- **Wireshark**

## Virtual box

VirtualBox is a free and open-source **virtualization software** developed by **Oracle** that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. It creates **virtual machines (VMs)** that act like separate computers, enabling you to install and run different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, without affecting your main operating system.

### **Key Features of VirtualBox:**
1. **Cross-Platform Support** â€“ Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
2. **Multiple OS Installation** â€“ Run different OSs simultaneously on the same machine.
3. **Snapshot Feature** â€“ Save the state of a VM and revert back if needed.
4. **Seamless Mode** â€“ Integrates guest and host OS interfaces.
5. **Shared Folders & Clipboard** â€“ Enables file sharing between host and guest OS.
6. **USB Device Support** â€“ Connect and use USB devices inside the VM.

### **Why Use VirtualBox?**
- **Software Testing** â€“ Run and test applications on different OSs.
- **Safe Experimentation** â€“ Try new software without affecting your main OS.
- **Learning & Development** â€“ Practice Linux or other OS environments without dual booting.
