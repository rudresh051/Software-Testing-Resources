Penetration testing (or **pen testing**) is a security testing process where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a system, application, or network to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. It helps organizations assess their security posture and fix weaknesses.

### **Types of Penetration Testing:**
1. **Black Box Testing** – Testers have no prior knowledge of the system.
2. **White Box Testing** – Testers have full knowledge of the system, including source code and architecture.
3. **Gray Box Testing** – Testers have partial knowledge, like access credentials but not complete system details.

### **Penetration Testing Process:**
1. **Planning & Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target system.
2. **Scanning** – Identifying open ports, services, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation** – Actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Assessing the impact of an attack.
5. **Reporting** – Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

### **Tools Used in Penetration Testing:**
- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Nmap**
- **Wireshark**
