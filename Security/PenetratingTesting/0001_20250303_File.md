Penetration testing (or **pen testing**) is a security testing process where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a system, application, or network to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. It helps organizations assess their security posture and fix weaknesses.

### **Types of Penetration Testing:**
1. **Black Box Testing** ‚Äì Testers have no prior knowledge of the system.
2. **White Box Testing** ‚Äì Testers have full knowledge of the system, including source code and architecture.
3. **Gray Box Testing** ‚Äì Testers have partial knowledge, like access credentials but not complete system details.

### **Penetration Testing Process:**
1. **Planning & Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Gathering information about the target system.
2. **Scanning** ‚Äì Identifying open ports, services, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation** ‚Äì Assessing the impact of an attack.
5. **Reporting** ‚Äì Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

### **Tools Used in Penetration Testing:**
- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Nmap**
- **Wireshark**

## Virtual box

VirtualBox is a free and open-source **virtualization software** developed by **Oracle** that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

* Security testing is essential to ensure that applications and systems are protected against threats and vulnerabilities. 

There are several types of security testing:

### 1. **Vulnerability Scanning**  
   - Uses automated tools to detect security loopholes.  
   - Example tools: Nessus, OpenVAS.  

### 2. **Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking)**  
   - Simulates real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.  
   - Types:  
     - Black Box (No prior knowledge of the system)  
     - White Box (Full knowledge of the system)  
     - Gray Box (Partial knowledge of the system)  

### 3. **Security Scanning**  
   - Identifies network and system weaknesses.  
   - Can be manual or automated.  

### 4. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Evaluates security risks based on impact and likelihood.  
   - Helps prioritize security measures.  

### 5. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**  
   - Analyzes source code without executing it.  
   - Example tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx.  

### 6. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**  
   - Tests a running application for vulnerabilities.  
   - Example tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.  

### 7. **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**  
   - Combines SAST and DAST by analyzing code during execution.  
   - Example tools: Contrast Security.  

### 8. **Fuzz Testing (Fuzzing)**  
   - Injects random inputs to find crashes and vulnerabilities.  
   - Example tools: AFL (American Fuzzy Lop), Peach Fuzzer.  

### 9. **Security Audit**  
   - Reviews security policies, compliance, and access controls.  
   - Often required for regulatory compliance (e.g., ISO 27001, HIPAA).

   - Certified ethical hackers test security systems legally.  
   - Example certification: CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker).  

### 11. **Compliance Testing (Security Compliance Assessment)**  
   - Ensures the system adheres to regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).  

### 12. **Red Team Testing**
