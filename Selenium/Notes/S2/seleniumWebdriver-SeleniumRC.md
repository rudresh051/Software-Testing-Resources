# Selenium WebDriver Vs Selenium RC

Selenium RC had a lot of limitations which eventually led  
to the development of Selenium WebDriver.

## 1. Architecture
The architecture of Selenium RC is complicated because it uses an intermediate RC Server to   
communicate with the browser.

## 2. Speed
Selenium WebDriver performs faster than Selenium RC because it interacts directly with the   
browser without using any external proxy server.

## 3. Object Orinted
Selenium WebDriver is purely object oriented API, whereas Selenium RC is less object oriented   
API.

## 4. Testing Mobile Applications
Selenium WebDriver supports OS (Operating System) for mobile applications like iOS, android.

## Browser Support
Selenium WebDriver also supports headless HTMLUnit browser (Invisible Browser).

Selenium RC doesn't support the headless HTMLUnit browser as it needs a real browser to work with.
