# Gecko Driver
The term Gecko refers to Gecko browser engine which was developed by Mozilla Foundation as a part of Mozilla browser.

Gecko Driver serves as a link between your tests in Selenium and the Firefox browser. It acts as a proxy between W3C WebDriver-compatible clients (Eclipse, Netbeans, etc.) to interact with Gecko-based browser (Mozilla Firefox).
