# Selenium Grid - Grid Architecture and Demo

Selenium Grid is a tool in the Selenium suite that facilitates parallel test execution by  
allowing tests to run on multiple machines or browsers concurrently, providing a  
scalable and efficient solution for distributed test automation.  

Selenium suite comprises four components.
1. SeleniuntGrid
2. Selenium IDE
3. Selenium RC
4. Selenium Webdriver

# Selenium Grid
* Selenium Grid is a feature in Selenium that allows you to run test cases in
different machines across different platforms. 

* The control of triggering the test cases is on the local machine, and when the
test cases are triggered, they are automatically executed by the remote
machine. Suppose you have 5 test cases. Your local machine is running
multiple applications, so you want to run yourtest cases in a remote machine.
You need to configure the remote server so that the test cases can be
executed there.
