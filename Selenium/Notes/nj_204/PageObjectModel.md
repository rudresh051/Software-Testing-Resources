# POM - Page Object Model

Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an  
object repository for storing all web elements.   
It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves  
test c.ase maintenance.  

Io simplify, in the Page Object Model framework, we create a class file for each web page.  

This class file consists or different web elements present on the web page. Moreover, the test scripts  
then use these elements to perform different actions.
