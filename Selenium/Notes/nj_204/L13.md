# Maven

Maven is a Build Management tool - used to build the code.

Features of Maven - 
1. **Dependencies** - We can easily mention Dependencies through Pom.xml

2. File Structure - src/test/java, src/main/java, src/main/resources/, src/test/resources

3. Build Management - With pom.xml we can build the software.

4. **Test the software with pom.xml**

5. We can integrate maven with Jenkins, Github for automating the execution process.




## Maven Build Life cycle

A Build Lifecycle is Made up of Phases

Each of these build lifecycles is defined by a different list of build phases, wherein a  
build phase represents a stage in the lifecycle.

For example, the default lifecycle comprises of the following phases (for a complete  
list of the lifecycle phases, refer to the Lifecycle Reference):  

* validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.  

* compile - compile the source code of the project

* test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These
tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed

* Package -  take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as
a JAR.

* verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are
met.

* install - install the package into the local machine, for use as a dependency in
other projects locally

* deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote
repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
