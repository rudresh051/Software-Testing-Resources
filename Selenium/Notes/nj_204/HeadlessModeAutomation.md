**headless browser automation with the fastest performance**,

### ðŸ¥‡ **Google Chrome (Headless)**

* **Best overall performance and speed**
* Excellent for modern websites
* Fast JavaScript execution (uses V8 engine)
* Headless mode (`--headless=new`) is stable and efficient
* Supported well by Selenium and tools like WebDriverManager

**Recommended For**: Speed, compatibility, and stability.

---

### ðŸ¥ˆ **Microsoft Edge (Headless)**

* Built on the same Chromium engine as Chrome
* Slightly heavier than Chrome due to Microsoft integrations
* Almost same performance, but marginally slower in benchmarks

**Recommended For**: When you specifically need Edge for enterprise apps.

---

### ðŸ¥‰ **Firefox (Headless)**

* Slower than Chromium-based browsers in headless mode
* Not as efficient for large-scale or high-speed automation
* Better for testing Firefox-specific quirks

**Recommended For**: Firefox-specific testing only.

---

### ðŸ›‘ **Not Recommended**

* **Safari**: No true headless mode
* **Internet Explorer**: Deprecated and very slow
* **Opera**: Niche, little automation support

---

### âœ… Verdict:

If speed is your top priority:

> **Use Google Chrome in headless mode with `--headless=new` and `--disable-gpu`.**

Would you like help updating your script to use Chrome instead of Edge in headless mode?
