# Introduction to BDD-Cucumber

## What is BDD?
BDD is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between business
people and technical people by:
* Encouraging collaboration across roles to build shared understanding of
the problem to be solved
* Working in rapid, small iterations to increase feedback and the flow of
value
* Producing system documentation that is automatically checked against
the system's behaviour

We do this by focusing collaborative work around concrete, real-world examples that  
illustrate how we want the system to behave. We use those examples to guide us  
from concept through to implementation, in a process of continuous collaboration.  

0k, now that you know that BDD is about discovery, collaboration and examples  
(and not testing), let's take a look at Cucumber.

Cucumber reads executable specifications written in plain text and validates that the
software does what those specifications say. The specifications consists of multiple examples,  
or scenarios.
