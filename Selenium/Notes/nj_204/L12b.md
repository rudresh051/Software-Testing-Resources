Assertions using TestNG

* What are Assertions in TestNG?  
Assertions in are a way to verify that the expected result and the actual  
result matched or not. If we could decide the outcome on different small  
methods using assertions in our test case, we can determine whether our test  
failed or passed overall.  

The word Assert means to state a fact or belief confidently or forcefully.   
In Selenium, Asserts are validations or checkpoints for an application.  
Assertions state confidently that application behavior is working as  
expected. Asserts in Selenium validate the automated test cases that help  
testers understand if tests have passed or failed.
