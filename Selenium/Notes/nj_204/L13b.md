# Introduction to CI-CD Jenkins & Integration with Selenium

Continuous Integration - Continuous Delivery, Continuous testing.

Jenkins is a CI-CD-CT tool.

Developers make changes the code, they will push it to GitHub.
Jenkins senses the changes in GitHub.

**WebHooks** - It helps Jenkins to detect the changes made by the developer.   
It will automatically deploy the code by itself.


Integration - Connection between different systems.

Continuous connection between developers, testers, DevOps and other teams.  

Automatically deploy, it also triggers automation testing code for execution.

Jenkins is a well-known open-source DevOps tool used in many   organizations CI/CD pipelines. Selenium is a popular open-source   automation tool for testing websites

**What is Jenkins?**
Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation sen√¶rthat can be   used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and   delivering or deploying software.  

**What is Continuous Integration?**
Continuous integration is the process of continuously checking-in the   developer's code into a version control system and triggering the build 
to check and identify bugs in the written code.  (Triggering the Automation scripts)

**What is Jenkins Pipeline? What is a Cl CD pipeline?**
The pipeline can be defined as the suite of plugins supporting the implementation and integration of continuous delivery pipelines in Jenkins.

Continuous integration or continuous delivery pipeline consists of build, deploy, test, release pipeline.

The pipeline feature saves a lot of time and error in maintaining the builds. Basically, a pipeline is a group of build jobs that are chained and integrated in sequence.

Whenever you change your code, Jenkins can automatically perform your Selenium tests and then deploy your code to a new environment if the tests pass.

**Poll SCM**
Jenkins allows you to set a time and date for executing your tests.

The Test Reports and performance logs can be saved for future reference.  

Jenkins can be used in a continuous integration setup with Maven to create and test.  

## Jenkins Installed
1. Make sure Jenkins is installed on your machine. You can download Jenkins from
https://jenkins.io/download/and follow the installation instructions.

java -jar jenkins.war

* ensure to have java 17 or 21
2. Navigate to tools and add path for Git, Maven and Java
3. Install plugins for Git and Mavan
