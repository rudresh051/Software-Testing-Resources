# Groups
TestNG Groups with Example  

We use groups in Testing when,
* We don't want to define test methods separately in different classes(depending upon functionality) and  
* At the same time want to ignore (not execute). Some test cases as if they do not exist in the code.
* So to carry out this we have to Group them. This is done by using the "include" and "exclude" mechanisms supported in TestNG

In the example below, we have shown the syntax of how to use groups in the XML file.

```
@Test (groups = {"smoke"})
```
