Equivalence test case design, often referred to as Equivalence Partitioning or Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP), is a software testing technique used to reduce the number of test cases by dividing input data into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived. The idea is that test cases derived from each partition should behave similarly, meaning that if one test case in a partition detects a defect, others are likely to detect the same defect, and vice versa.

Here are the key steps and concepts involved in equivalence test case design:

### Steps:

1. **Identify the Input Domain**:
   - Determine the range of input values for the system under test.

2. **Partition the Input Domain**:
   - Divide the input domain into classes or partitions of data where all values within each class are expected to be treated similarly by the system. These classes are known as equivalence classes.

3. **Identify Valid and Invalid Partitions**:
   - **Valid Partitions**: Classes that contain input data that are expected to be accepted by the system.
   - **Invalid Partitions**: Classes that contain input data that are expected to be rejected by the system or cause an error.

4. **Select Test Cases from Each Partition**:
   - Select representative test cases from each equivalence class, typically one from each class. This helps in minimizing the number of test cases while ensuring good coverage.

### Example:

Suppose we are testing a function that accepts an integer input between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

1. **Identify the Input Domain**:
   - The range of acceptable inputs is from 1 to 100.

2. **Partition the Input Domain**:
   - Valid partitions: 
     - 1 to 50 (Partition 1)
     - 51 to 100 (Partition 2)
   - Invalid partitions:
     - Less than 1 (Partition 3)
     - Greater than 100 (Partition 4)

3. **Select Test Cases from Each Partition**:
   - From Partition 1: Choose 25 (representative test case)
   - From Partition 2: Choose 75 (representative test case)
   - From Partition 3: Choose -5 (representative test case)
   - From Partition 4: Choose 150 (representative test case)

In this example, rather than testing every possible value between 1 and 100, we test a small number of representative values, which simplifies the testing process and increases efficiency.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of test cases needed to achieve reasonable test coverage.
- **Coverage**: Ensures that each equivalence class is tested, helping to uncover defects that could be missed with random testing.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies the process of test case selection and focuses on representative values.

### Conclusion:

Equivalence Partitioning is a fundamental test case design technique that helps testers create a comprehensive and efficient set of test cases by focusing on representative values from distinct partitions of the input domain. This method enhances testing efficiency and effectiveness by ensuring diverse scenarios are covered without unnecessary redundancy.
