Q 3 - How will you determine when to stop testing?

Ans: It can be hard to know when to stop testing. Many modern software applications are so complicated and run in such a relaxed environment that thorough testing is impossible. The following are some regular criteria to consider when considering when to end testing:

Deadlines are very important (release deadlines, testing deadlines, etc.)
Completed test cases with a certain percentage of passing
When the test budget runs out
When the coverage of code, functionality, or requirements arrives at a certain point, it is said to be complete
When the bug rate drops below a specific threshold
When the beta or alpha testing stage is over


## Q. How to do the Manual Regression testing?
Regression testing involves re-running previously executed test cases to ensure that recent changes or updates to the software have not introduced new defects or affected existing functionality. The selection of test scenarios for regression testing can indeed depend on the tester's judgment and understanding of the application's critical functionalities. Hereâ€™s a bit more detail:

### Key Points in Regression Testing:

1. **Identify Critical Functionality:**
   - Testers need to determine which functionalities are crucial for the application's core operations. These functionalities are more likely to be impacted by changes and should be included in regression testing.

2. **Impact Analysis:**
   - Assess the changes made to the software (e.g., bug fixes, new features, code refactoring) and analyze which parts of the application might be affected. This helps in selecting relevant test scenarios.

3. **Select Test Scenarios:**
   - Based on the impact analysis, testers select test scenarios that cover:
     - **Core Functionality:** Key features that are critical to the applicationâ€™s operation.
     - **Integration Points:** Areas where different parts of the application interact.
     - **High-Risk Areas:** Features that are prone to bugs or have been recently changed.
     - **Previous Defects:** Areas where bugs were previously found and fixed to ensure they don't reappear.

4. **Test Case Selection:**
   - For each selected test scenario, specific test cases are chosen to ensure thorough coverage. This can include both positive and negative test cases.

5. **Automation Considerations:**
   - If possible, automating regression test cases can save time and ensure consistency. Automated test cases can be rerun efficiently whenever changes are made.

### Summary
Regression testing involves a strategic approach to selecting and running test cases based on the criticality of functionalities, recent changes, and the potential impact of those changes. Testers use their judgment to ensure that the most important and affected areas of the application are thoroughly tested to maintain software quality.

## Which type of Testing to do in regression testing?
In regression testing, the primary focus is usually on **functional testing** rather than **UI/UX testing**. Here's why:

### Focus of Regression Testing:
1. **Functional Testing:**
   - **Purpose:** The main goal of regression testing is to ensure that existing functionalities still work as expected after changes have been made to the codebase (e.g., bug fixes, enhancements, or new features).
   - **Scope:** Test cases in regression testing typically focus on the core functionality, business logic, data processing, and system integration. These are areas where changes in the code are more likely to introduce defects.
   - **Examples:** Verifying that a login process still works, ensuring that data is correctly processed after a form submission, or checking that a calculation or algorithm still returns the correct results.

2. **UI/UX Testing:**
   - **Purpose:** UI/UX testing focuses on the look, feel, and usability of the application. It includes aspects like layout, responsiveness, visual elements, and user interaction flow.
   - **Scope:** While UI/UX is crucial for user satisfaction, it is less likely to be the primary focus in regression testing unless the recent changes directly affect the UI (e.g., a redesign or changes in the front-end code).
   - **Examples:** Ensuring that buttons are correctly aligned, verifying that navigation menus are intuitive, or checking that the application is responsive on different devices.

### Exceptions:
- **When UI/UX is Affected by Changes:** If the code changes are likely to impact the user interface or user experience (e.g., updating a front-end framework, changing UI components, or implementing a new design), then UI/UX aspects may be included in regression testing.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Some teams include visual regression testing as part of their regression testing suite, where automated tools capture screenshots and compare them pixel-by-pixel to detect any unintended visual changes.

### Summary
Regression testing primarily focuses on **functional aspects** of the application to ensure that recent changes have not broken existing functionality. **UI/UX testing** is generally not the main focus unless the changes directly impact the user interface or experience.
