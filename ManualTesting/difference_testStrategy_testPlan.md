## What is Test Plan?
The test plan is a base of software testing. It is a detailed document, which   
includes several testing attributes such as test objectives, scope, test schedule,   
template, required resources (human resources, software, and hardware), test estimation   
and test deliverables, risk, mitigation plan, defect tracking, entry and exit criteria,   
test environment, etc., which defines software testing areas and activities.

## What is a Test Strategy?
The test strategy is a high-level document used to validate the test levels to be executed   
for the product. And it also describes what kind of technique has to be used and which   
module will be tested.

It contains various components like documentation formats, objectives, test processes,   
scope, customer communication strategy, etc.

The Test Strategy's main purpose is to deliver a systematic approach to the software   
testing process to ensure reliability, quality, traceability, and better planning.
