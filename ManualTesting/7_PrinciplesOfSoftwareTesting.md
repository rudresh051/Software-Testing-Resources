## Principles of Software Testing

1. We should not do exhaustive testing
2. We should do early testing
3. Testing should be done to identify the bugs in the software
4. We should on **Pesticide paradox**  
Update the test cases regularly
5. We should focus on - **Defect clustering**
6. Testing is context independant(depending on the type of application and
customer requrements testing should be done)
7. Absence of errors in the software does not mean that software is free

## Challenges in Software Testing
1. Complexity of Software
2. Changing Technology
3. Regression Testing
4. Incomplete Requirements
5. Time constraints
6. Communication issues

### Test cases for Google Search
To verify that search field provides correct auto suggestion when some information is typed. Example: fac - Facebook

To verify that searcllfield auto corrects missFlled words entered and provides correct information

To verify for search for more results. pagination data is available.  
(When large set of data is displayed in a single page. pagination comes to the picture, instead of displaying all the  
data at oxe. it will be divided into chunks - 50.100,150200 etc)  

To verify that google search is aligned pr«y
