# Test cases for verifying different types of chart graphs:
## 1. Line Chart:

* Verify that the line connects the correct data points.
* Check if the labels on both axes are correctly displayed and formatted.
* Test with different datasets to ensure the line adjusts appropriately.
* Verify that the line chart handles missing or null data points gracefully.
* Test the behavior of tooltips when hovering over data points.

## 2. Bar Chart:
* Ensure that bars are correctly aligned and spaced.
* Test with negative and positive values to ensure correct rendering.
* Verify that the height of bars corresponds to the data values.
* Test with a large number of data points to ensure readability and performance.
* Check if the axes labels and values are correctly displayed.

## 3. Pie Chart:
* Verify that each slice represents the correct portion of the whole.
* Test with various data distributions, including equal distribution, skewed distribution,   
and extreme cases (e.g., one very large slice).
* Check for proper labeling within the pie chart, including slice labels and percentages.
* Test for accessibility, ensuring that color-blind users can distinguish between 
slices using patterns or labels.
* Verify that interactions such as click or hover events work as expected, displaying additional   
information or highlighting selected slices.

## 4. Scatter Plot:
* Verify that data points are plotted correctly according to their x and y coordinates.
* Test with various datasets to verify the scalability and performance of the scatter plot.
* Check for proper labeling of data points, including tooltips displaying additional information.
* Test the behavior of zooming and panning, if supported.
* Verify that trend lines or regression curves (if applicable) are calculated and displayed accurately.

## 5. Histogram:
* Ensure that bins are correctly calculated and displayed.
* Test with different bin sizes and ranges to ensure proper distribution visualization.
* Verify that the y-axis represents the frequency or density of data points within each bin.
* Check for proper labeling of axes and bins.
* Test with skewed datasets to ensure the histogram adapts appropriately.

## 6. Area Chart:
* Verify that the filled area accurately represents the data values.
* Test with overlapping data sets to ensure proper layering and visibility.
* Check for proper scaling and labeling of axes.
* Test with datasets containing null or missing data to ensure graceful handling.
* Verify that the area chart maintains readability and performance with large datasets.

## 7. Bubble Chart:
* Ensure that bubbles are sized and positioned correctly according to their data values.
* Test with various datasets to verify scalability and performance.
* Check for proper labeling of bubbles, including tooltips displaying additional information.
* Test the behavior of interactions such as hover or click events.
* Verify that the bubble chart handles overlapping bubbles gracefully.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure the accuracy, performance, and   
usability of different types of chart graphs. Adjustments may be necessary based on the   
specific requirements and features of the charting library or tool being used.
