# Test cases for verifying different types of chart graphs:
## 1. Line Chart:

* Verify that the line connects the correct data points.
* Check if the labels on both axes are correctly displayed and formatted.
* Test with different datasets to ensure the line adjusts appropriately.
* Verify that the line chart handles missing or null data points gracefully.
* Test the behavior of tooltips when hovering over data points.

## 2. Bar Chart:
* Ensure that bars are correctly aligned and spaced.
* Test with negative and positive values to ensure correct rendering.
* Verify that the height of bars corresponds to the data values.
* Test with a large number of data points to ensure readability and performance.
* Check if the axes labels and values are correctly displayed.

## 3. Pie Chart:
* Verify that each slice represents the correct portion of the whole.
* Test with various data distributions, including equal distribution, skewed distribution,   
and extreme cases (e.g., one very large slice).
* Check for proper labeling within the pie chart, including slice labels and percentages.
* Test for accessibility, ensuring that color-blind users can distinguish between 
slices using patterns or labels.
* Verify that interactions such as click or hover events work as expected, displaying additional   
information or highlighting selected slices.

## 4. Scatter Plot:
* Verify that data points are plotted correctly according to their x and y coordinates.
* Test with various datasets to verify the scalability and performance of the scatter plot.
* Check for proper labeling of data points, including tooltips displaying additional information.
* Test the behavior of zooming and panning, if supported.
* Verify that trend lines or regression curves (if applicable) are calculated and displayed accurately.

## 5. Histogram:
* Ensure that bins are correctly calculated and displayed.
* Test with different bin sizes and ranges to ensure proper distribution visualization.
* Verify that the y-axis represents the frequency or density of data points within each bin.
* Check for proper labeling of axes and bins.
* Test with skewed datasets to ensure the histogram adapts appropriately.

## 6. Area Chart:
* Verify that the filled area accurately represents the data values.
* Test with overlapping data sets to ensure proper layering and visibility.
* Check for proper scaling and labeling of axes.
* Test with datasets containing null or missing data to ensure graceful handling.
* Verify that the area chart maintains readability and performance with large datasets.

## 7. Bubble Chart:
* Ensure that bubbles are sized and positioned correctly according to their data values.
* Test with various datasets to verify scalability and performance.
* Check for proper labeling of bubbles, including tooltips displaying additional information.
* Test the behavior of interactions such as hover or click events.
* Verify that the bubble chart handles overlapping bubbles gracefully.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure the accuracy, performance, and   
usability of different types of chart graphs. Adjustments may be necessary based on the   
specific requirements and features of the charting library or tool being used.

# Test cases for verifying the responsiveness of graphs with different screen sizes and zoom levels

## Screen Size Test Cases:
* Test with various screen resolutions such as 1920x1080, 1366x768, 1280x800, etc.
* Verify the graph's appearance and readability on both small and large screens.
* Test on different devices like desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
* Ensure that the graph elements adjust dynamically to fit the screen without distortion or loss of information.

## Zoom Level Test Cases:

* Test graph behavior at different zoom levels, including 100%, 150%, and 200%.
* Verify that labels, legends, and data points remain clear and readable at each zoom level.
* Check if the graph maintains its aspect ratio and does not become disproportionate when zooming in or out.
* Ensure that interactive features such as tooltips and hover effects work correctly at all zoom levels.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility:
* Test the graph on various web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer (if supported).
* Ensure consistent behavior and appearance across different browsers, including older   
versions if applicable.
* Verify that the graph renders correctly and responds smoothly to changes in screen size   
and zoom level in each browser.

## Orientation Test Cases:
* Test the graph's responsiveness in both landscape and portrait orientations on mobile devices.
* Verify that the graph adjusts appropriately to the orientation change without overlapping or cutting off any elements.
* Ensure that the graph remains readable and visually appealing in both orientations.

## Dynamic Resize Test Cases:
* Test the graph's behavior when the browser window is resized dynamically.
* Verify that the graph elements resize smoothly and adjust their position to accommodate the new   
window dimensions.
* Check for any layout issues or visual glitches that may occur during resizing.

## Performance Test Cases:
* Measure the loading time of the graph on different devices and network conditions.
* Test the graph's performance when rendering large datasets or complex visualizations.
* Verify that the graph remains responsive and interactive without significant lag or delays.

## Accessibility Test Cases:
* Verify that the graph meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities.
* Test with screen readers to ensure that all graph elements are properly labeled and accessible.
* Check for sufficient color contrast and provide alternative text for non-text elements such as images and icons.  

By executing these test cases, you can ensure that the graph behaves as expected across   
various screen sizes, zoom levels, and other factors, providing a consistent and optimal   
user experience.
