# Testing the behavior of a browser's back button:
## Basic Navigation:

* Open a webpage and click on links/buttons to navigate to different pages within the same website.
* Use the browser's back button to return to the previously visited pages.
* Ensure that the expected page content is displayed upon navigating back.

## Form Submission:
* Fill out a form on a webpage and submit it.
* Use the browser's back button to return to the form page.
* Ensure that the form fields retain the previously entered values (if applicable).

## AJAX Requests:
* Navigate to a page that makes asynchronous requests (e.g., AJAX) to load content dynamically.
* Click on links or buttons to trigger AJAX requests and update page content.
* Use the browser's back button to return to previous states and verify that the page content reverts accordingly.

## State Changes:
* Perform actions that change the state of the webpage (e.g., toggling a dropdown, expanding a section, etc.).
* Use the browser's back button to navigate back and verify that the previous state is restored.

## Session State:
* Log into a website and perform various actions that are tied to the user's session.
* Use the browser's back button to navigate back to pages visited before and ensure that the session state remains consistent.

## Browser Compatibility:
* Test the behavior of the back button across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistency.

## Edge Cases:
* Test scenarios where the user performs multiple rapid clicks on the back button.
* Test scenarios where the user opens links in new tabs and then navigates back and forth between them using the browser's tab history.

## History Manipulation:
* Test for any attempts by the webpage to manipulate the browser's history (e.g., using JavaScript's   
history. pushState() or history.replaceState() methods) and ensure that the back button behaves as   
expected.

## Accessibility:
* Ensure that users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can effectively navigate using the back button.

## Error Handling:
* Test scenarios where errors occur during navigation (e.g., broken links, server errors) and   
verify that the back button behaves appropriately in such cases.
* These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure that the browser's back button functions   
correctly and reliably across different situations.


Banking applications like SBI often restrict navigation through the browser's back   
button due to security and user experience considerations:

1. **Security Concerns:**
   - Preventing users from navigating back with the browser's back button can help mitigate   
   security risks, such as session hijacking or unauthorized access.
   - By controlling the navigation flow within the application, banks can ensure that users   
     don't inadvertently land on cached pages containing sensitive information, such as account   
     details or transaction history.

2. **Prevention of Form Resubmission:**
   - Banking applications often involve form submissions for transactions or account management tasks.
   - Allowing users to navigate back to a page with a form submission could lead to unintended   
   resubmission of the form, potentially causing duplicate transactions or other errors.

3. **Transaction Integrity:**
   - For banking transactions, maintaining transaction integrity is crucial.
   - Disabling the browser's back button helps prevent users from navigating back to a previous step in   
   a transaction flow, which could disrupt the transaction process or lead to inconsistencies in account balances.

4. **User Experience Optimization:**
   - Banking applications typically strive to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
   - By controlling navigation within the application, banks can ensure that users follow predefined   
   flows and encounter fewer errors or confusion.

5. **Compliance Requirements:**
   - Regulatory requirements may also play a role in determining the navigation behavior of banking applications.
   - Banks need to comply with various security standards and regulations, and restricting browser   
    navigation may be a part of their compliance strategy.

Overall, while restricting navigation through the browser's back button may limit some user freedoms,   
it's often done to prioritize security, transaction integrity, and a seamless user experience in banking applications.
