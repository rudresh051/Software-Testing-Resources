## Component
In **Jira**, a **component** is basically a way to **categorize or group issues** within a project.
Think of it as a **sub-section or module of a project**.

### 🔹 Example:

Suppose your Jira project is **“E-Commerce Website”**.
You might create components like:

* **Frontend**
* **Backend**
* **Database**
* **Payment Gateway**
* **UI/UX**

Now, when you create a bug or a story, you can assign it to the relevant **component**.

### 🔹 Benefits of Components:

1. **Organization** → Easier to find and filter issues by area/module.
2. **Reporting** → Reports and dashboards can show progress or defect density per component.
3. **Ownership** → You can assign a **default assignee** to each component (e.g., Payment Gateway issues always go to Ravi).
4. **Traceability** → Helps track where most bugs are occurring.

👉 In short:
A **Component = a label for a part of the project** that helps organize, assign, and report on work.
