# Zephyr
Zephyr in testing (for Jira) is a **test management tool** that integrates directly with Jira. It helps QA teams plan, execute, and track their software testing activities inside the Jira environment.

Here’s a breakdown:

🔹 **Purpose**:
Zephyr extends Jira’s capabilities by adding structured **test management features**. Jira itself is more for issue and project tracking, but Zephyr brings in **test case management**.

🔹 **Key Features**:

* Create, organize, and manage **test cases** inside Jira.
* Link test cases to **user stories, epics, or requirements**.
* Execute manual and automated test cases.
* Track execution results (Pass/Fail/Blocked).
* Generate test reports and dashboards (coverage, progress, defects).
* Integrates with automation frameworks (Selenium, Jenkins, etc.).

🔹 **Types of Zephyr for Jira**:

1. **Zephyr Squad** – Lightweight, suited for smaller teams.
2. **Zephyr Scale** – Enterprise-level, with advanced reporting, hierarchy, and traceability.

👉 In short: *Zephyr turns Jira into a full-fledged test management solution, where you can manage test cases just like you manage issues.*

## Example
Perfect 👍 Let me walk you through a **real-world QA workflow using Zephyr for Jira**:

---

### 📌 Scenario: Testing a Login Feature

Your dev team built a new login page, and now QA needs to test it.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: **Create a Story in Jira**

* The Product Owner creates a Jira story: *“As a user, I should be able to log in with valid credentials.”*
* The dev team links commits and tasks to this story.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: **Create Test Cases in Zephyr**

Inside Zephyr, you add **test cases** related to the story:

1. **TC-101** – Verify login with valid credentials.
2. **TC-102** – Verify login with invalid password.
3. **TC-103** – Verify login with blank username/password.
4. **TC-104** – Verify “Forgot Password” link.

Each test case has:

* Steps to execute
* Expected result
* Priority
* Linked Jira story (requirement traceability)

---

### 🔹 Step 3: **Plan the Test Cycle**

* Create a **Test Cycle** in Zephyr (e.g., *Sprint 10 – Login Feature Testing*).
* Add the test cases (TC-101 to TC-104) into the cycle.
* Assign test cases to QA team members.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: **Execute the Tests**

During execution:

* QA opens TC-101 → Executes steps → Marks result as **Pass**.
* QA runs TC-102 → Finds a bug (login allows invalid password).

  * Logs a **Defect in Jira** directly from Zephyr and links it to TC-102.
* QA continues executing other test cases.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: **Track Results**

* The Test Cycle dashboard shows progress:

  * 2 Passed, 1 Failed, 1 Blocked.
* Jira board shows the linked defects.
* The team reviews test coverage and bug trends.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: **Reports & Metrics**

Zephyr generates reports such as:

* **Test Execution Status** → % of Passed/Failed/Blocked cases.
* **Traceability Report** → Which Jira stories are covered by tests.
* **Defects Linked to Test Cases** → Shows testing weak spots.

---

👉 **End Result**: Everyone (PO, devs, testers, managers) can see in **one place (Jira)** the story, test cases, execution results, and defects.
