# What is API
Application Programming interface
APIs defines the methods and protocols used for communication between different   
software systems. They enable developers to access and use the functionality and data   
of external services or systems

e.g. 
Customer goes in a hotel. Waiter gets an order. Waiter goes to the chef and gives   
back the order to the customer

Here Waiter act as the API

whereas web services are meant for computers to read

## What kind of information??
WSDL(Web Services Description Language)  
Its work is to describe how a web service works, what kind of messages it can send and   
understand and how to send and receive those messages.

Web services only support XML
