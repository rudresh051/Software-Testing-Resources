# What are the basic steps involved in API testing?

Here are the basic steps involved in API testing:

Step 1. Test planning: Define the scope, objectives, and requirements of API testing. Identify the endpoints to be tested and the expected behaviors.

Step 2. Test environment setup: Prepare the necessary test environment, including setting up test data, configuring test tools, and ensuring the availability of required dependencies.

Step 3. Test case design: Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including positive and negative test cases. Consider functional and non-functional aspects, such as input validation, error handling, and performance.

Step 4. Test execution: Execute the test cases, making API calls and verifying the responses against expected results. Capture relevant test data and log any issues encountered.

Step 5. Test reporting: Document the test results, including any defects or anomalies discovered during testing. Provide clear and detailed reports for easier analysis and issue resolution.

Step 6. Test maintenance: Regularly review and update test cases as the API evolves or changes. Maintain test data and keep the test environment up to date.

These steps provide a general framework for API testing and can be customized based on the specific requirements of your project.

## What are the different types of API tests?

* Unit testing:
Tests individual functions or methods within the API to ensure they work correctly and produce the expected outputs.

* Functional testing:
Validates the functional requirements of the API, covering scenarios and verifying that the API performs as intended.

* Integration testing:
Verifies the interaction between multiple components or systems, ensuring seamless communication and data exchange.

* Performance testing:
Evaluates the performance and scalability of the API under various load conditions, measuring response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

* Security testing:
Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the API's security measures, ensuring the protection of sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.

* Load testing:
Assesses the API's behavior and performance under expected and peak loads, ensuring it can handle the anticipated user traffic without degradation.

* Stress testing:
Pushes the API beyond its capacity limits to identify how it handles extreme loads and measure its resilience under stress conditions.

* Usability testing:
Tests the API's ease of use, including its clarity, user-friendliness, and intuitiveness.
