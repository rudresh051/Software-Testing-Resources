1. should the URL visible for different query and filter selected in dropdown should match?

```
Ideally, yes. In a well-designed web application, the URL should reflect the state of 
the application, including any query parameters and filters selected by the user. This 
practice, often referred to as "deep linking" or "bookmarkability," enhances usability 
and allows users to easily share or bookmark specific views of the application.

When a user selects different filters or queries using dropdown menus, the corresponding 
changes should be reflected in the URL through query parameters or fragments. This ensures 
that users can bookmark or share the URL to return to the same state later, and also allows 
for better integration with browser history and search engine indexing.

Matching the URL to the selected filters and queries also provides transparency to users about the current state of the application, which can improve user experience and reduce confusion.

Overall, maintaining consistency between the visible state of the application and the URL is a good practice for usability, accessibility, and search engine optimization.
