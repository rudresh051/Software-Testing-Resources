GovStrive's services likely involve both client-side and server-side components.   
Client-server architecture is commonly used in systems where clients (such as users'   
computers or devices) request services or resources from servers (centralized machines   
or systems) over a network. In GovStrive's case, clients (government agencies or organizations)   
would likely interact with their services through client-side interfaces (such as web browsers   
or dedicated applications), while the actual processing, storage, and management of data would 
occur on the server-side infrastructure managed by GovStrive. This architecture allows for 
efficient delivery of services, centralized data management, and scalability to accommodate 
the needs of their clients.
