# Agile Model
**User story** - Nothing but modules  
**epic** - Collection of user stories(complete set of requirements)

**sprint** - Actual time taken to `develop` and test one or more user stories

**Scrum Master** - He is a person responsible for quick delivery of project.  
He will assign to individual engineers and he will make sure all the tasks are completed.

**Release** - Release is a combination of sprint

1 project = 12 months = 12 releases  
`1 release = 1 month (20 days)`  ( 1 and 2 days we can leave)
Let's say 1 release = 2 sprints

**1 sprint = 10 days**  
1st sprint = 3 user stories(login, home page, about us)  
2nd sprint = 3 user stories(add to card, payment, terms & conditions)
