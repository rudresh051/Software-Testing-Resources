## Time-cost Trade-off - Crashing
* The critical path method is a very effective tool for
obtaining helpful information like
— the total completion time of a project,  
— the critical activities,  
— the non-critical activities  
— slack of various non-critical activities.  
* The execution of a project involves two types of costs
* Direct
  * The cost of materials  
  * Equipment  
  * direct labour (payroll, overtime, hiring and firing costs)  
  * If the activity is subcontracted and performed by a contractor,
then the activity's direct cost is equal to the price of the
subcontract.  
* Indirect costs. (indirect costs include office space rental, utilities, and
clerical and managerial staff salaries.)
* The total of the direct costs of all project activities is the
project's direct cost.
* If we desire to perform some activities at times shorter
than what they require, then the project cost would
increase.
* The project costs are the overhead charges related to the
project, which include the supervision and other charges,
late completion penalties and rewards for early
completion and so on
* The project's indirect costs are generally a function of
time the project takes to complete.
* Thus, the shorter the project duration lesser would be
the overhead.
* In short, a faster pace of work would mean higher
direct costs, while a slower rate of work would imply
otherwise.
* As indicated, the time-cost trade-off problem is based on the conception that the duration of some of the activities of a project can be cut down if some
additional resources—men, material and/or equipment—are employed on them.

## Crash time & Crash Cost
* For technical reasons, the duration of an activity cannot
be reduced indefinitely.
* The crash time represents the fully expedited or the
minimum activity time duration that is possible, and any
attempts to further 'crash' would only raise the activity
direct costs without reducing the time.
* The activity cost corresponding to the
crash time is
called the crash cost which equals the minimum direct
cost required to achieve the crash performance time.

## Normal Cost
* These are in contrast to the normal activity time and
the normal activity cost.
* The normal cost is equal to the absolute minimum of
the direct costs required to perform an activity.
* The corresponding activity duration is known as the
normal time—which may be stated more specifically
as the shortest time required to perform an activity
under the minimum direct cost constraint.
