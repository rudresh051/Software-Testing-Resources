## The Nature of Negotiation

* There are a variety of approaches for dealing with conflict, generally
speaking the favoured technique for resolving conflict is negotiation.
â€” Negotiation is a field of knowledge and endeavor that focuses on
gaining the favor of people from whom we want things
* "mediate," "make peace," "bring to
agreement,"
"arbitrate,"
"settle
differences,"
"compromise," "bargain"
"moderate,"
* Most of the conflicts that involve the organization
and outsiders have to do with property rights and
contractual obligations.
* In these cases, the parties to negotiation see
themselves as opponents.
* Conflicts arising inside the organization may also
appear to involve property rights and obligations, but
they typically differ from conflicts with outsiders
* As far as the firm is concerned, they are conflicts
between allies, not opponents
* Organizations, like groups, consist of interdependent
parts that have their
own values,
interests,
perceptions, and goals.
* Each unit seeks to fulfill its particular goal and the
effectiveness of the organization depends on the
success of each unit's fulfillment of its specialized
task.

## Lateral Relations

* One of the ways in which organizations facilitate this
integration is to establish
"lateral relations [which]
allow decisions to be made horizontally across lines
of authority"
* A lateral relationship in management is a link
between two employees of
the same
organization who are at the same level of
authority
* As each unit will have its own goals, integrating the
activities of two or more units is certain to produce
the conflicts that should not take place.
* The conflicts may, however, be resolved by
negotiating a solution, if one exists, that produces
gains (or minimizes losses) for all parties.

## The Nature of Negotiation

* The proper outcome of negotiation should be to optimize the outcome in
terms of overall organizational goals
* Although it is not always obvious how to do this, negotiation is clearly the
correct approach
**Some Requirements of Negotiation**  
* Few conflicts have to do with whether or not a task will be undertaken
* Instead, they have to do with the **design** of the deliverable
    * How
    * Whom
    * When
    * What cost
* The work of the project should get done
    * If not, everyone loses
* One requirement for the conflict reduction/resolution methods used by
the PM is that they must allow the conflict to be settled without
irreparable harm to the project's objectives
* A second requirement is that they allow (and foster) honesty between the
negotiators
* A third requirement of all conflicting parties is to seek solutions to conflict
that not only satisfy their own individual needs but also satisfy the needs
of other parties to the conflict, as well as the needs of the parent
organization

## Principled Negotiation

* Separate the people from the problem  
* Focus on interests, not positions  
* Before trying to reach agreement, invent options for mutual gain  
* Insist on using objective criteria  

## Ethics in negotiation

* During the negotiation process, an ethical situation
often arises that is worth noting.
* Consider the situation where a firm requests an
outside contractor to develop a software package to
achieve some function.
* When the firm asks for a specific objective to be
accomplished, it frequently does not know if that is a
major or a trivial task as it lacks technical competence in
that area
* Thus, the contractor has the opportunity to misrepresent
the task to its customer, either inflating the cost for a
trivial task or minimizing the impact of a significant task in
order to acquire the contract and later boosting the cost
* The ethics of the situation require that each party in
the negotiation be honest with the other, even in
situations where it is clear that there will not be
further work between the two

## Partnering, Chartering, and Scope Change

* Three situations commonly arising during projects that
call for the highest level of negotiating skill the PM can
muster:
    * The use of subcontractors
    * The use of input from two or more functional units to
design and develop the project's mission, and
    * The management of changes ordered in the project's
deliverables and/or priorities after the project is underway

### Partnering(Way of negotiation)

* In recent years there has been a steady growth in the frequency of
outsourcing parts of projects
* External suppliers, increasingly, are delivering parts of projects, including
tangible products and services as well as intangible knowledge and skills.
* There are many reasons beyond **avoidance Of litigation** that firms enter
partnering arrangements with each other
* For example - 
    * Diversification of technical risk
    * Avoidance of capital investment
    * Reducing political risk on multinational projects,
    * Shortening the duration of the project
    * Pooling of complementary knowledge, among others
* Traditionally, relations between the organization carrying out a project and
a subcontractor working on the project are best characterized as
adversarial.
* The parent organization's objective is to get the deliverable at the lowest
possible cost, as soon as possible.
* The subcontractor's objective is to produce the deliverable at the highest
possible profit with the least effort.
* These conflicting interests tend to lead both parties to work in an
atmosphere of mutual suspicion and antagonism.
* Indeed, it is almost axiomatic that the two parties will have si nificantl
different ideas about the exact nature of the deliverable
* Project partnering is a method of **transforming contractual relationships into a cohesive, cooperative
project team with a single set of goals and
established procedures for resolving disputes in a
timely and effective manner**

## Multistep process for building partnered projects

* First, the parent firm must make a commitment to
partnering, select subcontractors who will also make
such a commitment, engage in joint team-building
exercises, and develop a "charter" for the project
* Second, both parties must implement the partnering process with a four-part agreement on:  
    * "joint evaluation" of the project's progress
    * a method for resolving any problems or disagreements
    * acceptance of a goal for continuous improvement (also
known as "total quality management," or TQM) for the
joint project
    * continuous support for the process of partnering from
senior management of both parties.
* Finally, the parties commit to a joint review of
"project execution" when the project is completed.
* Each step in this process must be accompanied by
negotiation, and the negotiations must be non-
adversarial
* The entire concept is firmly rooted in the assumption
of mutual trust between the partners, and this assuption, too, requires non-adversarial negotiation

## Partening beyond two parties
* The concept Of partnering, however, goes far beyond two-party
agreements between buyer and seller or interdepartmental cooperation
on a project.
* The use of multiparty consortia to pursue technological research
objectives is common.
* There are a great many such groups Of competitors engaged in
cooperative research and other cooperative activities
* They exist worldwide and are often multinational in their membership
* For example, Airbus Industry (originally British, French, Spanish, and
German) and International Aero Engines (originally the US, Japan,
Germany, Italy, and the UK)
* Airbus Industry is not only a consortium of private firms from four
different nations, but each of the four governments subsidized their
respective private firms.
* This venture, apparently undertaken in order to foster a European
competitor to the United States' Boeing Aircraft, resulted in a successful
competitor in the market for commercial aircraft.

## Partnering - Problems

* There can be no doubt that those who have not had
much experience with partnering underrate its
difficulty.
* Partnering requires strong support from senior
management of all participants, and it requires
continuous support of project objectives and
partnering agreements
* Above all, and most difficult of all, it requires open
and honest communication between the partners.
* With all of its problems, however, partnering yields
benefits great enough to be worth the efforts
required to make it work correctly

## Chartering(way of negotiation)
* A project (program, etc.) charter is a **detailed written
agreement between the stakeholders in the project**,
that is, the client or sponsor, the PM, senior
management, the functional managers
**who are
committing resources and/or people to a specific
(program, etc.), and even possibly others
project**
such as community groups or environmental entities
* Charter may take many different forms.
* Typically, it gives an overview of the project and
details
the expected deliverables,
including
schedules, personnel, resource commitments, risks,
and evaluation methods
* It attests to the fact that all the stakeholders are "on
the same page," agreeing about what is to be done,
when, and the cost
* Note that if there is such an agreement, there is also an implication that
none of the parties will change the agreement unilaterally, or, at least,
without prior consultation with the other stakeholders.
* Many projects do not have charters, which is one
reason that many projects do not meet their scope,
are not completed on time, and/or are not completed
on budget.

### Sample Charter
An informal project charter appears in Cowen et al. (1992,), in which
the various members of the partnering team sign a commitment to - 
    * Meet design intent
    * Complete contract without need for litigation
    * Finish project on schedule
    * Timely resolution of issues
    * Manage joint schedule
    * Keep cost growth to less than 2 percent

* Of course, to meet the underlying purpose of a charter, even these less-
specific terms assume an agreement on the "design intent," the schedule,
and costs.

## Scope Change
* The problem of changing the scope expected of a project is a major issue
in project management and constitutes part of the second PMBOK
knowledge area.
* No matter how carefully a project is planned, it is
almost certain to be changed before completion.
* No matter how carefully defined at the start, the
scope of most projects is subject to considerable
uncertainty.

### Three basic causes for change in projects

* Some changes result because planners erred in
their initial assessment about how to achieve a
given end or erred in their choice Of the proper
goal for the project.
* Technological uncertainity is the fundamental causal factor for either error
  * The foundation for a building must be changed because a preliminary
geological study did not reveal a weakness in the structure of the ground on
which the building will stand.
    * The project team becomes aware of a recent innovation that allows a faster,
cheaper solution to the conformation of a new computer
* A third source of change is the mandate. This is a change in the
environment in which the project is being conducted.
    * As such, it cannot be controlled by the PM.
    * A new law is passed.
    * A government regulatory unit articulates a new policy.
    * A trade association sets a new standard.
