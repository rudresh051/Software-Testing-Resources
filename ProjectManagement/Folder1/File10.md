## The Nature of Negotiation
* There are a variety of approaches for dealing with conflict, generally
speaking the favoured technique for resolving conflict is negotiation.
— Negotiation is a field of knowledge and endeavor that focuses on
gaining the favor of people from whom we want things
* "mediate," "make peace," "bring to
agreement,"
"arbitrate,"
"settle
differences,"
"compromise," "bargain"
"moderate,"
* Most of the conflicts that involve the organization
and outsiders have to do with property rights and
contractual obligations.
* In these cases, the parties to negotiation see
themselves as opponents.
* Conflicts arising inside the organization may also
appear to involve property rights and obligations, but
they typically differ from conflicts with outsiders
* As far as the firm is concerned, they are conflicts
between allies, not opponents
* Organizations, like groups, consist of interdependent
parts that have their
own values,
interests,
perceptions, and goals.
* Each unit seeks to fulfill its particular goal and the
effectiveness of the organization depends on the
success of each unit's fulfillment of its specialized
task.

## Lateral Relations

* One of the ways in which organizations facilitate this
integration is to establish
"lateral relations [which]
allow decisions to be made horizontally across lines
of authority"
* A lateral relationship in management is a link
between two employees of
the same
organization who are at the same level of
authority
* As each unit will have its own goals, integrating the
activities of two or more units is certain to produce
the conflicts that should not take place.
* The conflicts may, however, be resolved by
negotiating a solution, if one exists, that produces
gains (or minimizes losses) for all parties.

## The Nature of Negotiation

* The proper outcome of negotiation should be to optimize the outcome in
terms of overall organizational goals
* Although it is not always obvious how to do this, negotiation is clearly the
correct approach
**Some Requirements of Negotiation**  
* Few conflicts have to do with whether or not a task will be undertaken
* Instead, they have to do with the **design** of the deliverable
- How
- Whom
- When
- What cost
* The work of the project should get done
— If not, everyone loses
* One requirement for the conflict reduction/resolution methods used by
the PM is that they must allow the conflict to be settled without
irreparable harm to the project's objectives
* A second requirement is that they allow (and foster) honesty between the
negotiators
* A third requirement of all conflicting parties is to seek solutions to conflict
that not only satisfy their own individual needs but also satisfy the needs
of other parties to the conflict, as well as the needs of the parent
organization

## Principled Negotiation
Separate the people from the problem  
Focus on interests, not positions  
Before trying to reach agreement, invent options for mutual gain  
Insist on using objective criteria  

## Ethics in negotiation
* During the negotiation process, an ethical situation
often arises that is worth noting.
* Consider the situation where a firm requests an
outside contractor to develop a software package to
achieve some function.
