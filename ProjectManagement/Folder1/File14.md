* Project Planning with Scrum
* Scrum Artifacts Supporting Project Planning
* Scrum Events for Project Planning

## Project Charter

* A charter is a high-level document that helps define the scope of the project and is typically submitted to get project approval to move on to develop a project plan.
* The project charter serves as a reference point
throughout the project's lifecycle and helps ensure
that everyone involved in the project has a shared
understanding Of its goals, objectives, and
requirements.

## A Typical Project Charter - Elements

* **Project purpose and goals:** A clear and concise
statement of the project's purpose and objectives.
* **Project scope:** A description of what is included and
excluded from the project.
* **Project stakeholders:** A list of all individuals and
organisations involved in the project and their roles
and responsibilities.
* **Project timeline:** A schedule of project milestones,
including start and end dates.
* **Project Budget:** An estimate of the cost of the project
and its resources.
* **Project risks:** An assessment of the potential challenges
and obstacles that may arise during the project.
* Project deliverables: A list of the expected outcomes and
results of the project

## Agile Project Planning

* We have been discussing the traditional method for planning projects, known as the "Waterfall" approach.
* Traditional approaches have proven to work well for many projects.
* There are projects for which the traditional methods do
not suffice, mainly because they assume that the
project's scope can be well determined and the
technology of developing the scope is well understood.

* Since change is a constant,
**Agile Project Management
(APM)** was developed to embrace change rather than
resist it like Waterfall project management.
* Indeed, a key characteristic of APM is that it
incorporates adaptive planning such that the project
plan is updated as circumstances change.
* Employing adaptive planning is particularly valuable for
projects characterised by uncertainty, requirements that vary, and short deadlines
* From time to time, we have mentioned the fact that software and IT projects have had a very high failure rateâ€”over budget, over schedule, and delivering less than the desired output.
* Software projects are more uncertain than construction projects, often due to unclear project objectives and lack of understanding by the client
or project team.
* The result, understandably, has a high probability of client
dissatisfaction with the completed project.
* The table in the next slide further contrasts APM from the traditional
Waterfall approach on multiple dimensions.

### Waterfall vs agile

* While the Waterfall method is commonly viewed as a
"batch" process, APM is viewed as a flow process,
where deliverables are produced in a "flow" manner.
* An analogy often used is that of a cake, which is built
in horizontal layers, but consumed in vertical slices.
* Waterfall project management attempts to deliver
the **entire cake**, while APM delivers a tiny layer at a
time.
* That is, the work is divided up so that smaller
segments can be completed rapidly, that is, via
sprints, and presented for review, feedback, and
hopefully offering value for the client.
* During the duration of each sprint, the client has
agreed to "freeze" the scope so that the tasks can
be considered fixed or concrete.
* This feedforward of results from the project team to
the client and the feedback from the client to the
team allows for a collaborative project environment,
which strongly enhances the likelihood of project
success.
* This close and continuing contact distinguishes APM
between clients and the project team and an
iterative and adaptive planning process.
* Project requirements are a result of client/team
interaction, and the requirements change as the
interaction leads to a better understanding of both sides
of the project requirements, priorities, and limitations
* Waterfall approach with its emphasis on the schedule
first, then the scope, and lastly, the team
* APM emphasis is on the customer first, the team second,
and the scope third
