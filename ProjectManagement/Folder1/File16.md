Environmental and Social Feasibility  

## What is Project feasibility analysis?

* Project feasibility analysis is a
**critical process that
organizations undertake to assess the viability,
sustainability, and potential success of a proposed
project** before committing significant resources.
* It helps stakeholders make informed decisions by
evaluating various aspects of the project.

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

* Market Feasibility
— Assess the demand for the product or service
in the target market  
— Analyze market trends, size, and potential
growth  
— Identify target customers and their needs. 

### Steps for Market Feasibility

*  Given the importance of market and demand analysis, it should be carried out
systematically.  
The key steps in such analysis are  

situational analysis and specification of objectives  
collection of secondary information  
conduct a market survey
characterisation of the market
demand forecasting
market planning

### Sources of Secondary Information

* Information may be obtained from secondary and primary sources
* Secondary information is information that has been gathered in some
other context and is already available
* While secondary information is available economically,
its reliability, accuracy, and relevance for the purpose
under consideration must be carefully examined.
* Secondary information, though useful, often does not provide a
comprehensive basis for market and demand analysis.
* It needs to be supplemented with primary information gathered through a
market survey specific to the project being appraised.
* It is likely to be a sample survey.

### Sample survery for Market Feasibility  

Typically, sample survey consists of the following steps -   

Define the target population  
Select the sampling schemes and sample size  
Develop the questionaire  
Scrutinize the information gathered  
Analyze and interpret the information  

## Market for the Product/Service

* Based on the information gathered from secondary sources and through market
survey, the market for the product/service may be described in terms of the following:  
— Effective demand in the past and present  
— Breakup of demand  
— price  
— Methods of distribution and sales promotion  
— Consumers  
— Supply and competition  
— Government policy  

## Estimating the future demand

* After gathering information about various aspects of the market and demand
from primary and secondary sources, an attempt may be made to estimate
future demand.
* A wide range of forecasting methods is available to the market analyst.
* These may be divided into three broad categories:
— Qualitative methods  
— Time series projection methods  
— Causal methods  

### 1. Qualitative methods

* Qualitative methods rely on experts' judgment to translate qualitative
information into quantitative estimates.
* The important qualitative methods are:
    * Jury of executive method
    * Delphi method

### 2. Time series

* Time series projection methods generate forecasts based on an
analysis of the historical time series.
* The important time series projection methods are:
• Trend projection methods  
• Exponential smoothing method  
• Moving average method  

### 3. Bass diffusion model and causal method

* The Bass diffusion model seeks to estimate the
pattern of sales growth for new products in
terms of two factors: p, the coefficient of
innovation and q, the coefficient of imitation.
* Causal methods seek to develop forecasts
based on cause-effect relationships specified in
an explicit, quantitative manner

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

* Technical Feasibility
— Evaluate the technical requirements and challenges of the project.
— Assess the availability Of technology and expertise needed.
— Consider any potential obstacles in implementing the technology.

## Purpose of Technical Analysis

* The broad purpose of technical analysis is
(a) to ensure that the project is technically feasible in the sense that all
the inputs required to set up the project are available and  
(b) to facilitate the most optimal formulation of the project in terms of
technology, size, location, and so on.
