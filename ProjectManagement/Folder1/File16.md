## What is Project feasibility analysis?

* Project feasibility analysis is a
**critical process that
organizations undertake to assess the viability,  
sustainability, and potential success of a proposed  
project** before committing significant resources.  
* It helps stakeholders make informed decisions by
evaluating various aspects of the project.

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

* 1. **Market Feasibility**  
— Assess the demand for the product or service
in the target market  
— Analyze market trends, size, and potential
growth  
— Identify target customers and their needs. 

### Steps for Market Feasibility

*  Given the importance of market and demand analysis, it should be carried out
systematically.  
The key steps in such analysis are  

situational analysis and specification of objectives  
collection of secondary information  
conduct a market survey
characterisation of the market
demand forecasting
market planning

### Sources of Secondary Information

* Information may be obtained from secondary and primary sources
* Secondary information is information that has been gathered in some
other context and is already available
* While secondary information is available economically,
its reliability, accuracy, and relevance for the purpose
under consideration must be carefully examined.
* Secondary information, though useful, often does not provide a
comprehensive basis for market and demand analysis.
* It needs to be supplemented with primary information gathered through a
market survey specific to the project being appraised.
* It is likely to be a sample survey.

### Sample survery for Market Feasibility  

Typically, sample survey consists of the following steps -  

Define the target population  
Select the sampling schemes and sample size  
Develop the questionaire  
Scrutinize the information gathered  
Analyze and interpret the information  

## Market for the Product/Service

* Based on the information gathered from secondary sources and through market  
survey, the market for the product/service may be described in terms of the following:  
— Effective demand in the past and present  
— Breakup of demand  
— price  
— Methods of distribution and sales promotion  
— Consumers  
— Supply and competition  
— Government policy  

## Estimating the future demand

* After gathering information about various aspects of the market and demand  
from primary and secondary sources, an attempt may be made to estimate  
future demand.
* A wide range of forecasting methods is available to the market analyst.
* These may be divided into three broad categories:
— Qualitative methods  
— Time series projection methods  
— Causal methods  

### 1. Qualitative methods

* Qualitative methods rely on experts' judgment to translate qualitative
information into quantitative estimates.
* The important qualitative methods are:
    * Jury of executive method
    * Delphi method

### 2. Time series

* Time series projection methods generate forecasts based on an
analysis of the historical time series.
* The important time series projection methods are:
• Trend projection methods  
• Exponential smoothing method  
• Moving average method  

### 3. Bass diffusion model and causal method

* The Bass diffusion model seeks to estimate the  
pattern of sales growth for new products in  
terms of two factors: p, the coefficient of  
innovation and q, the coefficient of imitation.
* Causal methods seek to develop forecasts
based on cause-effect relationships specified in
an explicit, quantitative manner

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

* 2. Technical Feasibility
— Evaluate the technical requirements and challenges of the project.  
— Assess the availability Of technology and expertise needed.  
— Consider any potential obstacles in implementing the technology.  

## Purpose of Technical Analysis

* The broad purpose of technical analysis is
(a) to ensure that the project is technically feasible in the sense that all
the inputs required to set up the project are available and  
(b) to facilitate the most optimal formulation of the project in terms of
technology, size, location, and so on.  

## Choice of Technology

A variety of considerations influences the choice of technology:
Plant capacity  
principal inputs  
Investment outlay and production cost  
Use by other units  
Product mix  
Latest developments & Ease of absorption  

## Appropriateness of Technology

* Appropriate technology refers to production methods suitable to local
economic, social, and cultural conditions.
The advocates of appropriate technology urge that the technology should be  
evaluated in terms of the following questions:  
* Does the technology utilise local raw materials and
man power?
* Do the goods and services produced cater to basic needs?
* Whether the technology protects ecological balance?
* Whether the technology is harmonious with social and
cultural conditions?

### Technical Arrangements

* Satisfactory arrangements must be made to obtain the technical know-
how for the proposed manufacturing process.
* When collaboration is sought, among other things, the following aspects
of the agreement must be worked out in detail.

**Material Inputs and Utilities**  
Material inputs and utilities may be classified into four broad categories -  

1. raw materials
2. processed industrial materials and components
3. auxiliary materials and factory supplies
4. utilities

**Product Mix**  

* Market requirements guide the choice of product mix.
* In the production Of most items, Size and quality variations aim to satisfy a
broad range of customers.
* For example, a garment manufacturer may have a wide range in size and
quality to cater to different customers.

### Plant Capacity(Production capacity)

* Plant capacity (or production capacity) refers to the volume or number of units
manufactured during a given period.
* Several factors have a bearing on the capacity decision.
— Technological requirement  
— Input constraints  
— Investment cost  
— Market conditions  
— Resources Of the firm  
— Govemmental policy  

### Location and Site

* The choice of location and site follows an assessment of demand, size, and
input requirements.
* Location refers to a reasonably broad area like a city, an industrial zone, or
a coastal area; site refers to a specific piece of land where the project
would be set up.

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

### 3. Financial Feasibility

* Estimate the initial and ongoing costs of the project.
* project revenue streams and potential profitability.
* Perform a cost-benefit analysis.

### Cost of Project

* Conceptually, the cost Of the project represents the total Of all items Of
outlay associated with a project supported by long-term funds.
* It is the sum of the outlays on the following:
  * Land and site development  
  * Buildings and civil works  
  * Plant and machinery  
  * Technical know-how and engineering fees  
  * Expenses on foreign technicians and training of Indian technicians abroad
  * Miscellaneous fixed assets
  * preliminary and capital issue expenses
  * Pre-operative expenses
  * Margin money for working capital
  * Initial cash losses

### Means of Finance

* To meet the cost of the project the following means of finance are available:
— Share capital  
— Term loans  
— Debenture capital  
— Deferred credit  
— Incentive sources  

### Cost of Production

* Given the estimated production, the cost of production may be worked
out
* The significant components of cost of production are:
— Material cost  
— Utilities cost  
— Labour cost  
— Factory overhead cost  

### Estimates of Sales and Production

* Typically, the starting point for profitability projections is the forecast of sale:
revenues.
* In estimating sales revenues, the following considerations should be borne in
mind:
* It is not advisable to assume a high-capacity utilization level in the
first year of operation.
* Even if the technology is simple and the company may not face  
technical problems in achieving a high rate of capacity utilization in  
the first year itself, there are likely to be other constraints like raw  
material shortage, limited power, marketing problems, etc. 

### Working Capital Requirement and its Financing
* In estimating the working capital requirement and planning for its financing, the following points have to be borne in mind:
* The working capital requirement consists of the following:
(i) raw materials and components (indigenous & imported)  
(ii) stocks of goods-in-process (also referred as work-in-process)  
(iii) stocks of finished goods  
(iv) debtors  
(v) operating expenses  
(vi) consumable  

### Project Cash Flow Statement
* The cash flow statement shows the movement of cash into and out of the firm and its net impact on the cash balance within the firm

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

### 4. Environmental and Social Feasibility
— Assess the environmental impact of the project.  
— Consider social and community aspects.  
— Evaluate the project's sustainability and corporate
social responsibility.  

**Environmental Feasibility considerations**  
Impact Assessment -   
* Evaluate the project's potential environmental impacts, such as air and  
water pollution, deforestation, habitat disruption, and other ecological  
consequences.

* Compliance with Regulations - 
Ensure the project complies with local, national,  
and international environmental regulations and  
standards.

* Sustainability - 
Assess the project's sustainability by examining  
resource use, waste generation, and the overall  
ecological footprint.

**Social Feasibility**  
Definition -   
Social feasibility involves analysing the potential impact of a project on  
the community, society, and stakeholders.

**Social Feasibility considerations**
* Stakeholder Analysis:  
Identify and assess the concerns and interests Of
various stakeholders, including local communities,
employees, customers, and other relevant parties.
* Community Impact:  
Examine how the project may affect the social fabric
of the community, including changes in
demographics, employment, and overall well-being.
* Cultural Considerations:
Take into account the cultural aspects of the
community and ensure that the project respects and
integrates with local customs and values.
* Social Responsibility:
Evaluate the project's commitment to social
responsibility, including issues like fair labor practices,
human rights, and community development labour
