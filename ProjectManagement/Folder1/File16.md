## What is Project feasibility analysis?

* Project feasibility analysis is a
**critical process that
organizations undertake to assess the viability,
sustainability, and potential success of a proposed
project** before committing significant resources.
* It helps stakeholders make informed decisions by
evaluating various aspects of the project.

## Components in a project feasibility analysis

* Market Feasibility
— Assess the demand for the product or service
in the target market  
— Analyze market trends, size, and potential
growth  
— Identify target customers and their needs. 

### Steps for Market Feasibility

*  Given the importance of market and demand analysis, it should be carried out
systematically.  
The key steps in such analysis are  

situational analysis and specification of objectives  
collection of secondary information  
conduct a market survey
characterisation of the market
demand forecasting
market planning

### Sources of Secondary Information

* Information may be obtained from secondary and primary sources
* Secondary information is information that has been gathered in some
other context and is already available
* While secondary information is available economically,
its reliability, accuracy, and relevance for the purpose
under consideration must be carefully examined.
* Secondary information, though useful, often does not provide a
comprehensive basis for market and demand analysis.
* It needs to be supplemented with primary information gathered through a
market survey specific to the project being appraised.
* It is likely to be a sample survey.

### Sample survery for Market Feasibility  

Typically, sample survey consists of the following steps -   

Define the target population  
Select the sampling schemes and sample size  
Develop the questionaire  
Scrutinize the information gathered  
Analyze and interpret the information
