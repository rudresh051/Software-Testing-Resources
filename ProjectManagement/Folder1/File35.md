## Project Closure
* A project can be said to be closed
    * **when work on the substance of the project has ceased or
slowed** to the point that further progress on the project is
no longer possible,
    * When **the project has been indefinitely delayed**
    * when **its resources have been deployed to other projects**
    * when project personnel (especially the PM) become
**personae non-gratae** with senior management and in the
company lunchroom.

## The Varieties of Project Closure
There are 4 fundamentally different ways to close out a project - 
1. Extinction
2. Addition
3. Integration
4. Starvation

### 1. Closure by Extinction
* The project is stopped.
* It may end because it has been successful and achieved its goals:
    * The new product has been developed and handed over to the Client, or the software has been installed and is running at the client's facility.
* The project may also be stopped because it is unsuccessful or has been
superseded:
    * The new drug failed efficacy tests, and alternatives are available for
better, faster, cheaper, or prettier results, or it may be too expensive
and take too long to achieve the desired performance.
* Changes in the external environment can kill
projects as well.
* The explosion of the Challenger shuttle
stopped several space shuttle projects
overnight.

### 2. Closure by Addition
* Most projects are "in-house," that is, carried out by the
project team for use in the parent organization.
* If a project is a major success, it may be closed by
institutionalizing it as a formal part of the parent
organization
* For example, most software engineering and/or information systems
departments began by reorganizing an engineering or business school
"subspecialty" into a full-fledged department.

### 3. Closure by Integration
* This method of closing a project is the most common way of dealing with
successful and complex projects.
* The property, equipment, material, personnel, and functions of the
project are distributed among the existing elements of the parent
organization.
* The output of the project becomes a standard part of
the operating systems of the parent or client.

### 4. Closure by Starvation
* There is a fourth type Of project closure, although Strictly speaking, it is not a "closure" at all.
* It is **"slow starvation by budget decrement."**
* Project managers involved in projects for a significant period have faced Budget cuts during business recessions.
* Budget cuts, or decrements, are not rare.
* Because they are common, they are sometimes used to
mask a project closure
* There may be several reasons why senior management does not wish to
close an unsuccessful or obsolete project.
* In some firms, for example, it is politically dangerous to admit that one has championed a failure, and closing a project that has not accomplished its goals is an admission Of failure.
* The project budget may be significantly reduced,
potentially halting project progress and necessitating
the reassignment of numerous team members.
* The project is technically closed, but it still exists as a
legal entity with sufficient staff, including an
administrative assistant who annually issues a "no-
progress" report.

## Critical success factors for Project Implementation
* **Project Mission**
— Clearly defined goals and general directions.
* **Top-Management Support**
— Willingness of top management to provide the
necessary resources and authority/power for
project success.
* **Project Schedule/Plan**
— A detailed specification of the individual action
steps for project implementation.
* **Client Consultation**
— Communication, consultation, and active
listening to all impacted parties.
* **Personnel**
— Recruitment, selection, and training
necessary personnel for the project team.
* **Technical Tasks**
— Availability of the required technology and 
expertise to accomplish the specific technical
action steps.
* **Client Acceptance**
— The act of "selling" the final project to its intended
users.
* **Monitoring and Feedback**
— Timely provision of comprehensive control
information at each stage in the implementation
process.
* **Communication**
— The provision of an appropriate network and
necessary data to all key actors in the project
implementation.
* **Trouble-shooting**
— Ability to handle unexpected crises and deviations
from plan.
