## Attributes of Effective Project Managers
**Most popular attributes, skills and qualities for selecting PMs**
On good terms with senior executives  
Someone who can keep the project team happy  
Worked in several departments  
Can walk on (or part) the waters  

### Credibility
1. Technical Credibility

* Possessing sufficient technical knowledge to direct the project  
* Have a basic understanding of the base technologies on which the project
rests, explain project technology to senior management  
* Able to interpret the technical needs and wants of the client (and senior
management) to the project team.

2. Administrative credibility
* One of the administrative responsibilities is to the client
and senior management  
— to keep the project on schedule and within cost and
to monitor reports  
* Another responsibility is to the project team
— to make sure that material, equipment, and labour
are available when and where needed  
* Another responsibility is to represent the interests of all stakeholders
(team, management, functional departments, community, and client) to one another  
* The PM is genuinely the "person in the middle."
* Finally, the PM is responsible for making the tough trade-off decisions for  
the project and must be perceived as a person who has the mature  
judgment and courage to do so consistently

### Sensitivity
1. Political Sensitivity


* The political sensitivity attribute is essential for project managers  
* Projects are multidimensional and are inherently affected by politics  
* The key is to be aware of politics, to work with them, but not be part of them  
* A competent leader continually balances five projects "currencies" - time, money,
knowledge, security, and prestige  

2. Interpersonal sensitivity

* PM needs to sense interpersonal conflict on the project team or between
team members and outsiders.
* Successful PMs are not conflict avoiders- they sense conflict early, then
confront and deal with it before it escalates into interdepartmental and
intradepartmental warfare.
* The PM must persuade people to cooperate irrespective of personal  
feelings, keep aside personal likes and dislikes, and to focus on achieving  
project goals.

3. Technical sensitivity
* It is common for otherwise competent and honest team members to try to
hide their failures.
* Team members with this orientation may not be able to tolerate their  
failures (though they are rarely as intolerant of failure in others) and may  
hide failure rather than admit to it.
* PM must be able to sense when things are being "swept under the rug"  
and are not progressing properly



### Leadership, ethics, and management style
* Leadership
    - "a process of social influence, which maximises the efforts of others,  
towards the achievement of a goal"
* Strong sense of ethics
* A management style that fits the project
