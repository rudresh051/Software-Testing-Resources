# Lecture 19 : Quantitative Risk Assessment Methodologies

## Agenda
* Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
* Decision Tree Analysis
* General Simulation Analysis
    * Monte-Carlo Simulation
* Sensitivity Analysis

## Failure Mode and Effect Analysis(FMEA)
* FMEA is the application of a scoring model
* It is straightforward and extensively used, particularly in engineering,
and is easily applied to risk using six steps.
