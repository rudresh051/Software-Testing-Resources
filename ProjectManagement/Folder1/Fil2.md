* The Project Life Cycle and its types
* Risk During the Life Cycle

## Non-projects

* Non-project refers to all activities or tasks that
are ongoing and do not stop when the project
completes
* The use of a manufacturing line to produce a
flow of standard products is a non project
* e.g. 
    * production of weekly employment reports
    * preparation of school lunches
    * delivery of mail
    * Checking your e-mail
    * They are all routine
    * They are tasks that are performed repeatedly

## Quasi-Projects

* Quasi project is a project that does not have specific
tasks identified, no specific budget, and no specific
deadline
* There is a disconnect between the timeframes and
project objectives
* This poorly conceived notion trickles down into other
project parameters such as budgets, unique product or
service, project targets and due dates.

## Managing Quasi-Projects

* How can you plan a project when you don't
know the scope requirements?
* The project is determining the scope
requirements
* Set the determination of resources, budget,
deadline, capabilities, personnel, and any
other matters as the first milestone

## Why Project Management?

* Contemporary society demands the development of new methods of management
* Three forces are paramount:
    * Exponential expansion of human knowledge
    * Growing demand for a broad range of complex, sophisticated, customised goods and services
    * Evolution of worldwide competitive markets for the production and consumption of goods and services
* The primary purpose for initiating a project is to accomplish specific goals
* The reason for organising the task as a project is to focus the
responsibility and authority for the attainment of the goals on an
individual or small group

* Three forces combine to mandate the use of **teams
to solve problems** that used to be solvable by
individuals
* Combining also increases the complexity of **goods
and services** produced plus the **complexity of the
processes** used to produce them
* Leads to the need for more sophisticated systems to
control both outcomes and processes

## Benefits of Project Organization

Project form of organisation allows the manager to be responsive to
* The client and the environment
* Identify and correct problems at an early date
* Make timely decisions about trade-offs between conflicting project goals
* Ensure that managers of the separate tasks that comprise the project do
not optimise the performance of their tasks at the expense of the total
project

## Advantage of Project-based organizations

* Experience better control and better customer
relations
* Increase in their project's return on investment
* Shorter development times, lower costs, higher
quality and reliability, and higher profit margins
* Sharper orientation toward results, better
interdepartmental coordination, and higher
worker morale.

## Disadvantage of Project-based organizations

* Results in greater organisational complexity
* Increases the likelihood that organizational
policy will be violated
* Higher costs, more management difficulties,
and low personnel utilisation
* Conflict

## Limitations of Project Management
* The creation of a project may be an admission
that the parent organisation and its managers
cannot accomplish the desired outcomes through
the functional organisation
* Conflict seems to be a necessary side effect
