## Benefits Realization
* When the project execution effort has been completed, the project owner (PO), sponsor, and PM must close it out by seeing that the project
personnel, equipment, and remaining resources are correctly transferred to their correct locations and uses.
* If this was a project closure by addition, these resources may, in fact, Stay with the project output, including possibly the personnel, for utilization within the organization.
* Nevertheless, there may still be
    * contractual and legal documents and payments that need to be
completed
    * administrative affairs to attend to
    * final reports to be written

* Next, the official **benefits realization stage begins for
the PO.**
* **Benefit Realization** is the tasks facing the project owner
in order to achieve the benefits desired from the
project.
* In other words, Benefit realization refers to a method
for
identifying, defining, planning and monitoring
benefits as associated with plans and processes.
* The goal of this process is to
ensure that the team
fulfils all promised benefits after they have followed all
due processes.
* It also includes the execution of these benefits.
* Of course, the PO has been preparing for this stage
throughout the execution of the project by working
with the appropriate functional manager and other
users of the project outputs.
* As noted earlier, the PO may be the functional
manager if the project was intended for this function.

## Phases in Benefits Realization
* Still, there probably are other users of the project
outputs, either on a regular or on an intermittent basis.
* There are three primary phases to this final stage of the
project.
* The first phase is the biggest and involves implementing
the project's outputs as they were intended.
* The second phase is the
handoff to the functional manager to ensure that the benefits obtained
will continue to be realized.
* The third phase is the routine use of the outputs,
where the PO writes the benefits realization report
for the funder and steering committee.

## Issues in Benefits Realization
* Implementing the proper use of the outputs is a difficult task.
* It is often the case that the intended customers/users of the outputs don't
want to change the procedures they have been using, which are comfortable
and routine.
* They don't take on the complex tasks of learning new procedures and risking
the chance that they won't understand this new method
* This is commonly known as **"resistance."**
* That is especially the case if they have not been
involved in designing the new system or even been
informed about the change until it was dumped on
them.
* Another danger is that they will use the new system
for a while and slowly revert to their previous system,
which may have been less work.
* That is, often a new system may be better overall for
the company but is more work for some employees.
* All these behavioural issues are even more
complicated if the new system involves complex and
confusing technology for the employees, especially
computers.
* There are other reasons as well for employees to
resist adopting a new system.
* Many times, it simply does not work as it is supposed
to, so the firm ends up reverting to the old system.
* Then all that training and hassle and time spent have
been just a bothersome waste.
* Other times, a new manager arrives and disagrees
that this system is worth the trouble.
* Or a new top executive/administrator arrives and
has a different idea of how the organization should
operate and terminates funding for the new system.
* The PO must initiate preparation for this stage well in advance of the project
execution due to potential pitfalls.
* But the preparation may need to be adjusted as the project plan changes,
which presents other problems for the PO.
* For example, there is the possibility that the customer training may begin
too early before the new system is fully operational and debugged.
* Then, if the system has to be drastically changed, it is likely that the
training will have to be redone as well, which tends to drive the users
nuts!
* It is no wonder that their response is: "I'll start the
training after you've figured out what the final system
is going to be."

## Tools used in Benefits Realization
* As the PO prepares the customers to implement the
new system, many tools are available,
typically training.
* However, there may also be education classes,
motivational events such as tours of other organisations that use a similar system,
and other ways of engaging and motivating these intended users.
* Beyond training in new procedures, though, there may also be new
responsibilities for the customers or reorganizations of the workgroups or
departments.
* All this adds to the headaches for the PO, so it is no wonder that it is so
difficult to obtain the intended benefits from a **"successfully completed"** project.

## Phases in Benefits Realization
* The next phase is the handoff to the functional if the PO is not that person.
manager
* During this phase, the functional manager typically
oversees user training, administration, oversight,
human resources, and general management despite
the potential dangers and difficulties.
* Beyond this, however, the PO needs to be sure
that at some point in the future, the users do not
slip back into old habits and routines
so that the handoff will be a slow one.
* For example, it is familiar with new technology implementations in
manufacturing for the PO to stay around until production reaches 80 percent utilisation with the new system.
* It is also well recognized that when a new system is installed, productivity
is immediately dropped.
* But then productivity slowly starts to rise back up, eventually returning to
its previous level, and then improving even further and gaining the benefits
desired by the funder.
* And at some point in this last routine-use phase, the PO's job is complete.
* It may be when the system reaches 80 percent of the benefits expected,
or more, or less, depending on the organization and situation.
* However, at some point, the PO must be satisfied that the desired benefits
will continue.
* Similarly to the Sydney, Australia Opera House, the worldwide familiarity
and admiration of the structure took years after completion to develop.

## Importance of Benefits realization
* It is highly important to a project's success as it provides organizations
with the needed tools for success and progress.
* This success can be reflected in different forms, including:
    * Prevention of delays
    * Implementation of each promised benefit
    * Avoidance of simple and major errors
    * Fair consumption of resources
    * Efficient change management

## Afterword: Project Management practices and success
* A survey was conducted with responses from 142 active project
managers.
* The frequency of use of each PMBOK project management practice was
scored on a five-point scale (never, seldom, sometimes, frequently,
always).
* The use of was the time management techniques
highest, with a score of 4.03 for the average of seven
time-related practices (project schedule and updates,
baseline schedule, PERT/Gantt charts, activity lists,
duration estimates, and updates).
* Risk had the lowest average score with an average
of 2.79 for the six related practices (risk
management plan, contingency plan, risk register,
quantitative risk analysis, register updates, and
preplanned responses).

## Project Management lessons from ISRO's Chandrayaan-3
* India became the fourth nation to accomplish a soft
lunar landing when the Indian Space Research
Organization (ISRO) succeeded in making history by
landing on the moon's dark side.
* India's space technology advancements offer a blueprint
for other nations and public and private organizations to
explore the ultimate frontier.
* As project managers, what are the lessons that we can
learn?

### 1. Precise Planning and Risk Management
* Among the mission's most difficult stages, the soft landing
on the moonis south pole was carried out without a hitch.
* The enhanced Chandrayaan-3 landing gears, which are
intended to absorb stress loads, emphasize how crucial it
is to foresee hazards and make necessary preparations.
* It's critical in project management to recognize potential
hazards and establish backup strategies.

### 2. Cross-Functional Collaboration of team - 
* In space exploration, people from various professions
work together to achieve a common goal.
* This cross-functional collaboration strengthens the
team's unity and focus on a single objective.
* Successful communication, teamwork, and a common
understanding of the goals are necessary for team
members and stakeholders to coordinate with ease.

### 3. Agile Adaptability
* Project managers need to be agile, as demonstrated
by Chandrayaan 3's flexibility in the face of unforeseen
obstacles.
* The mission has contingency measures in place to deal
with any unforeseen problems and to modify its
approach and timeframe accordingly.
* The project's leaders demonstrated adaptability,
quick change of course, and skill in transforming
challenges into opportunities despite volatile
conditions.

### 4. Resource optimization
* ISRO completed the mission successfully and at a
relatively low cost with the utmost precision.
* The way resources are distributed in Chandrayaan 3
emphasizes how important resource optimization is.
* Project managers demonstrated the ability to
identify past challenges and explore optimal
solutions for optimizing resources, including time,
money, and developing technology.
* The job will be completed effectively and efficiently
thanks to constraints and output optimization.

### 5. Leadership Amidst Uncertainty
* The problematic parts Of Chandrayaan 3 highlight
the value Of maintaining the course in the face Of
uncertainty.
* Project managers must be adept at giving their team
members guidance, clarity, and comfort while
instilling confidence and a sense of purpose—even
in trying circumstances.

### 6. The power of persistence
* While the second mission faced its challenges,
ISRO's determination to forge ahead is a testament
to the importance of persistence in project
management.
* Every setback is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and
come back stronger.

### 7. Learning and Adapting from past experiences
* Effective project management is characterized by its
capacity to draw lessons from past mistakes.
* The success Of Chandrayaan-3 was based on the
knowledge gained from Chandrayaan-2.
* The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter's data was essential in
raising the mission's success rate.
* Continuous improvement depends on this iterative
process, in which each project builds on the lessons
learned from the ones that came before it.

### 8. Timing and Strategic Planning
* The project ensured an ideal track to the moon by
utilizing an eccentric earth orbit.
* In the same way, knowing when to Start a project,
when to commit resources, and when to hold off can
all have a big impact on how well the project turns
out.

### 9. Diversification for Stability
* The variety of equipment on board Chandrayaan-3's
lander Vikram emphasizes the value of diversification.
* Just like Vikram had a variety of tools to guarantee the
success of his mission, projects should also have a
variety of tactics and techniques to guarantee that
they can adjust to unforeseen obstacles and changing
conditions.

* The journey of Chandrayaan-3 to the south pole of the moon is not only an
amazing tale of space exploration but also a project management
masterpiece.
* It illustrates the genius of project management that enables such missions
by providing lessons in tenacity, flexibility, risk management, and strategic
planning.
