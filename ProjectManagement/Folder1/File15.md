## What is Project Integration Management

* Project integration management is the coordination of all elements of a project.
* This includes coordinating tasks, resources, stakeholders, and any other project elements, in addition to managing conflicts between different aspects of a project, making trade-offs between competing requests, and
evaluating resources.

## Why is project integration management so important?

* Keeping track of everything and knowing how one
factor impacts the others can be very challenging.
* However, if it is not done properly, it can lead to project failure
* The most difficult aspect of implementing the plan for
a complex project is the coordination and integration
of the various elements of the project so that they
meet their joint goals of scope, schedule, and budget
in such a way that the total project meets its goals.

## Multidisciplinary teams(MTs) and Integration Management

* As projects become more complex, the problem of
coordinating multidisciplinary teams (MTs) becomes
more troublesome.
* At the same time, and as a result, uncertainty is
increased.
* Rather than operating as a team, they work as separate and distinct parts,
each of which has its own tasks and is not much interested in the other parts.
* The intricate process of coordinating the work and timing of the different
groups is called *integration management.*
* There is general agreement that MT has a favorable
impact on product/service design and delivery
* Hauptman et al. (1996, p. 161) shows that MTS have
had a "favorable impact on attainment of project
budget goals, but achieves this without any adverse
impact on quality, cost or schedule."
* Recent work on managing the interfaces focuses on the use of MTS to plan the project as well as design the products/services the project is intended to produce.
* The process was also associated with higher levels of team job satisfaction
* The use of MTS in product development and planning is not without its difficulties
* Successfully involving cross-functional teams in project planning requires that some structure be imposed on the planning process
* The most common structure is simply to define
the task of the group as having the responsibility
to generate a plan to accomplish whatever is
defined as the project scope.
* There is considerable evidence that this is not sufficient for complex projects.
* Using MT creates what might well be considered a "virtual" project.
* In previous lecture, we noted the high level of conflict in many virtual projects.
* It follows that MT tends to involve conflict.
