## Importance of Planning

* Peter Drucker has quoted on planning: "Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work."
* To make such a transformation possible is no easy task.
* Every minute given to planning saves 10 minutes in execution.
* Effective planning requires avoiding the opposite pitfall of killing the plan with over-analysis.
* This leads to the well-known "paralysis by analysis."

## Purpose of planning

* The primary purpose of planning is to establish a set of directions in sufficient
detail to tell the project team
    * Exactly what must be done
    * When it must be done
    * What resources will be required to produce the
deliverables of the project successfully
    * When each resource will be needed.

## Tools for gathering information for planning

* The entire planning process is dependent on gathering the correct
requirements from the client or project owner in the first place
* PMBOK lists several tools and techniques to help in doing this, including
— Interviews  
— Focus groups  
— Facilitated workshops  
— Group creativity techniques questionnaires  
— Surveys  

## Requirements for a good planning
* The plan must be designed by the PM, overseen by the
project owner and sponsor
* The plan should meet the Project outcome and the direct
and ancillary objectives of the parent organisation, as
reflected by the project portfolio, business case, or other
strategic selection process used to approve the project.
* It is always carried out in an environment of uncertainty
* The plan must include allowances for risk and features that allow it to be adaptive, that is, to be responsive to things that might, and often do,
disrupt it while it is being carried out
* The plan must also contain methods to ensure its integrity, which is to say
it must include means of controlling the work it prescribes
* The plan must include any constraints on activities and input materials
proscribed by law and society, a group of critical stakeholders
* Among the many sources of outside constraints are the
    * Food and Drug Administration
    * Occupational Health and Safety Administration
    * Other Central and state laws and regulations
    * Various engineering societies
    * Labor unions and "Standard Practices" of many industries

## Objective of planning
* To facilitate later accomplishment
* The world is a whole of plans that never become
deeds
* It is a complicated process to manage a project, and
plans act as a map of this process
* The map must have sufficient detail to determine
what must be done next but be simple enough that
workers are not lost

## Process of Planning
* The process may be described formally, but it does not occur formally.
* Bits and pieces of plans are developed by individuals, by informal group
meetings, or by formalised planning teams, and then improved by other
individuals, groups, or teams, and improved again and again.
* Both plans and the process of planning should start
simply with the **project charter**, which is then
elaborated on and eventually becomes the **project
plan**

## Traditional Project Planning - Launch Meeting
* A senior manager call and be present at the project chartering workshop
or "launch" meeting, an initial coordinating meeting, as a visible symbol of
top management's commitment to the project
* The sponsor and other key stakeholders should
participate in this meeting for the purpose of
establishing the project, agreeing on the top
deliverables, discussing resourcing, establishing
schedule and budget tolerances and defining risks
