## Gantt Chart

* One Of the oldest but still one of the most valuable methods of presenting project schedule
information is the Gantt chart
* Developed around 1917 by
Henry L. Gantt,
pioneer in the field of scientific management.
* The Gantt chart shows planned and actual progress
for several tasks displayed as bars against a
horizontal timescale.
of indicating the
* It is a particularly
**effective and easy-to-read method**
actual current status for each of a set of tasks compared to the planned
progress for each item of the set.
* As a result, the Gantt chart can be **helpful in expediting, sequencing, and
reallocating resources among tasks, as well as in the valuable but mundane
job of keeping track** of how things are going.
* Charts usually contain a number of special symbols to designate or highlight
items of special concern to the situation being charted.
* It is essential for the student to be able to understand just what it is that
networks and Gantt charts show.
* Once understanding is gained, software is easier, faster, and given a project
of a size that reflects reality, far more cost-effective.

### Benefits of Gantt Charts

* First, even though they may contain a great deal of
information, they are easily understood
* While they do require frequent updating (as does any
scheduling/control device), they are easy to maintain as long
as task requirements are not changed or major alterations of
the schedule are not made
* Gantt charts provide a picture of the current state of a project.
* They are as easy to construct as a network.

### Weakness of Gantt charts

* If a project is complex with a large set of activities, it
may be very difficult to follow multiple activity paths I
through the project
* Gantt charts are powerful devices for communicating
to senior management, but networks are usually more
helpful in the hands-on task of managing the project.

### Gantt Chart-Example 

* Its major strength is that it is easy to read
* All popular project management software will prepare Gantt charts, and
most have some options available for customization
* On balance, ease of construction and ease of use have made the Gantt chart
the most popular method for displaying a project schedule.
* Nonetheless, an AON network is still most useful for
the PM to exercise control over the schedule, and the
viewer may be misled if the Gantt chart is not read
carefully or if it does not contain all appropriate
information (Wilkens, 1997)

### Precedence Diagramming Restrictions

* Finish to start
    * Activity 2 must not start before Activity 1 has been
completed.
* This is the typical arrangement of an activity and its
predecessor.
* Other finish—start arrangements are also possible.
* If the predecessor information had been written "IFS +
2 days," Activity 2 would be scheduled to start at least 2 days
after the completion of Activity 1, as shown in Figure .
* For instance, if Activity 1 was the pouring of a concrete
sidewalk, Activity 2 might be any activity that used the
sidewalk.

* Start to start
    * Activity 5 cannot begin until Activity 4 has
been underway for at least 2 days.
    * Setting electrical wires in place cannot begin
until 2 days after framing has begun.

* Finish to finish
    * Activity 7 must be complete at least 1 day before
Activity 8 is completed.
    * If Activity 7 is priming the walls of a house, Activity
8 might be the activities involved in selecting,
purchasing, and finally delivering the wallpaper.
    * It is important not to hang the paper until the wall
primer has dried for 24 hours.

* Start to finish
    * Activity 11 cannot be completed before 7 days since
the start of Activity 10.
    * If Activities 10 and 11 are the two major cruising
activities in a prepaid week-long ocean cruise, the
total time cannot be less than the promised week.
    * The S—F relationship is rare because there are usually
simpler ways to map the required relationship

## Gantt Chart in MS Project
<<>>
* When we open MSP, the Gantt chart view is typically the default view
displayed (at any time you can display the Gantt chart view by clicking on the
Gantt chart button on the far left of the Task ribbon).
* The Gantt chart view contains two windows.
* On the left is a window that contains a form that is used to enter WBS data into the program.
* The Gantt chart is displayed in the right window
