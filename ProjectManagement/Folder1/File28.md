## The Planning-Monitoring-Controlling Cycle
* The key things to be planned, monitored, and controlled
**time (schedule), cost (budget), and scope are (performance).**
* These, after all, encompass the fundamental objectives
of the project.
* However, we are finding that with more complex
projects, scope is usually by far the most important of the three and invariably changes,
sometimes substantially, as the project progresses.
* Hence, the need for the project owner to work closely with the sponsor and PM.
* There is no doubt that some organizations do not spend sufficient time and effort on planning and controlling projects.
* It is far easier to focus on doing, especially because it appears to be more effective to "stop all the talk and get on with the work."
* We could cite firm after firm that incurred great expense because the planning process was inadequate for the tasks undertaken

### Example of improper planning
1. A major construction project ran over budget by 63 percent and over schedule by 48 percent because the PM decided that, since "he had managed similar projects several times before, he knew what to do
without going into all that detail that no one looks at anyway.
2. A large industrial equipment supplier "took a bath" on a project designed to develop a new area of business because they applied the same planning
and control procedures to the new area that they had used (successfully) on previous, smaller, less complex jobs.
3. A computer store won a competitive bid to supply a computer, five
terminals, and associated software to the Kansas City office of a national firm.
    * Admittedly, insufficient planning made the installation significantly late.
    * Performance of the software was not close to specified levels.
    * This spoiled job prevented the firm from being invited to bid on more than 20
similar installations planned by the client

### Put the hassles up front
* The planning (budgeting and scheduling) methods
we propose **"put the hassles up front."**
* They require a significantly greater investment of time and energy early in the life of the project, but they significantly reduce the extent and cost of poor performance and time/ cost overruns.

## The Planning-Monitoring-Controlling Cycle
* It is useful to perceive the control process as a **closed-loop system,** with
revised plans and schedules (if warranted) following corrective actions.
* It is also useful to construct this process as an internal part of the
organizational structure of the project, not something external to and
imposed on it or, worse, in conflict with it.
* Finally, experience tells us that it is also desirable, though not mandatory,
that the planning—monitoring—controlling cycle be the normal way of life in the parent organization.
* What is good for the project is equally good for the parent firm.
* In any case, unless the PM has a smoothly operating monitoring/ control system, it will be difficult to manage the project effectively

## Designing the Monitoring System
* The first step in setting up any monitoring system is to identify the key factors to be controlled.
* Clearly, the PM wants to monitor scope, cost, and
time but must define precisely which specific
characteristics of scope, cost, and time should be
controlled and then establish exact boundaries
within which control should be maintained.
* There may also be other factors of importance
worth noting at least at milestones or review
points in the life of the project.
* For example, the number Of labor hours used, the
number or extent of process or output changes,
the level of funder satisfaction, and similar items
may be worthy of note on individual projects.

### Designing the Monitoring System - WBS 
* But the best sources of items to be monitored are
the project work breakdown structure (WBS),
change of scope orders, and the risk management
plan.
* The WBS describes what is being done, when, and
the planned level of resource usage for each task,
work package, and work element in the project.
* Monitoring the risks found in the risk management
plan keeps the PM and project team alert to
specific risks and thus lowers the probability of
surprises.
* The monitoring system is a direct connection
between planning and control.
* If it does not collect and report information on some significant element of the plan, control can be faulty or missing.
* The WBS furnishes the key items that must be
measured and reported to the control system, but it
is not sufficient.
* For example, the PM might want to know about changes in the client's
attitudes toward the project.
* Information on the morale of the project team might be useful in preparing
for organizational or personnel changes on the project.
* These two latter items may be quite important but are not usually reflected
in the project's WBS.
* Unfortunately, it is common to focus monitoring
activities on data that are easily gathered—rather than
important—or to concentrate on "objective" measures
that are easily defended at the expense of softer, more
subjective data that may be more important to
control.
* Above all, monitoring should concentrate primarily
on measuring various facets of output rather than
intensity of activity.
* It is crucial to remember that effective PMs are not primarily interested in how hard their project teams work.
* They are interested in achieving results

## Designing the Monitoring System - The measurement of Project performance
* The measurement of project performance usually poses the most difficult
data gathering problem.
* There is a strong tendency to let project inputs serve as surrogate
measures for output.
* If we have spent 50 percent of the budget (or of the scheduled time), we assume that we have also
completed 50 percent of the project or reached 50
percent of our performance goal.
* If the item being referenced is a small work unit, it does not make a
significant difference if we are wrong.
* If, however, the reference is to a task or to the entire project, the input/output of
proportionality (hereafter, the assumption
"proportionality rule") is often seriously misleading.
* Further, it is common to specify performance to a level of precision that is
both unnecessary and unrealistic or a level of lenience that is worthless.
* For example, a communications software project specified that a
telephone "information" system had to locate a phone number and
respond to the queries in 5 seconds or less.
* Is 5.1 seconds a failure?
* Does the specification mean 5 seconds or less every time or merely that
response times should average 5 seconds or less?
* Is the specification satisfied if the response time is 5 seconds or less than
90 percent of the time?
* The monitoring systems we described, however, focus mainly on time and
cost as measures of performance, not scope (performance).
* While we are most certainly concerned with keeping the project "on spec,"
and do consider some of the problems of monitoring output, the subject is
not fully developed here because the software designed to monitor projects
is not constructed to deal with performance adequately

## Monitoring - five telltale signs of project trouble
Alderton (2013) suggests five indicative signs of project trouble it is wise to monitor
1. **Muddy Waters**
* The project plan is often the starting point for project trouble, especially if it is
unduly long or confusing in its goals, scope, deliverables, and processes.
* "The most common cause of troubled projects...is that the scope is not well
defined or well understood."
* Vague or incomplete project requirements are a major
red flag.
2. **Mysterious Stakeholders**
* Full and detailed stakeholder descriptions and analysis are key to avoiding late problems and delays.
* Incomplete documentation of all stakeholders is a major risk for any project.
* There should be two versions of the stakeholder description:
  * A formal one that identifies who each one is, their role, how to reach them, and their preferred mode of communication.
* The other also includes whether they are a supporter of the project or a detractor, or perhaps a fence sitter, so the PM can anticipate any trouble that may occur later and get to these people early to head it off

3. **Unconstrained Constraints**

* Knowing how much leeway there is in your schedule and budget for each
task, and where delays or cost overruns can be made up, keeps a project
out of trouble.
* "If you don't have a detailed project schedule, the chance of the project
failing increases exponentially."
* Milestones are especially important since they usually have the least give.
* Establish tolerance limits on each task, and intervene when they are
exceeded.

4. **Suspicious Status Reports**

* Status reports that are unclear, inconsistent, late, or lack specific measures
are a red flag for coming trouble.
* Vague or overly optimistic language such as "very soon" or "marginal increase" in costs also indicates trouble ahead.

5. **Discord and Drama**

* Unhappy team members can cause major trouble in the project, though hard to detect early on.
* Meeting minutes can show team members who are consistently missing, have low participation, or seem to have excessive objections and complaints.
* The PM needs to be a coach and mentor for the team by establishing trust
and respect within the team and an open and honest feedback
environment.
* Create a positive team dynamic as soon as possible

## Information Needs and Reporting
* Reports are issued less often.
* In both cases, the structure of the reports should
reflect the WBS, with each managerial level
receiving reports that allow the exercise Of
control at the relevant level.
* At times, it may be necessary to move
information between organizations, as illustrated
in Figure , as well as between managerial levels.
* The proliferation of electronic mechanisms along with a wide array of
software has made the process of collecting and disseminating information
much faster and less arduous than previously.
* In addition to its use for conducting the routines of
project management, the Internet is a rich source of
information, including databases on almost anything,
patent information, and technical aid for managing
projects, to mention only a small fraction of readily
available information.
* Many current project management software packages allow easy
connection to the Internet and e-mail to transmit information, charts,
networks, and

## The Reporting Process
* The relationship Of project reports to the project WBS is the key to the
determination of both report content and frequency.
* Reports must contain data relevant to the control Of specific tasks that are
being carried out according to a specific schedule.
* The frequency of reporting should be great enough to
allow control to be exerted during or before the
period in which the task is scheduled for completion.
* For example, efficacy tests of drugs do not produce rapid results in most
cases.
* Thus, there is no reason for weekly (and perhaps not even monthly) reports
on such tests.
* When test results begin to occur, more frequent reports and updates may be
required.

## Benefits of timely reports
There are many benefits of detailed, timely reports delivered to the proper
people. Among them are:  
* Mutual understanding of the goals of the project
* Awareness of the progress of parallel activities and of the
problems associated with coordination among activities
* Understanding the relationships of individual tasks to one
another and to the overall project
* Early warning signals of potential problems and delays in the
project
* Minimizing the confusion associated with change by reducing
delays in communicating the change
* Higher visibility to top management, including attention directed
to the immediate needs of the project
* Keeping the client and other interested outside parties up to
date on project status, particularly regarding project costs,
milestones, and deliverables

## Report Types
* For the purposes of project management, we can consider three distinct
types of reports: routine, exception, and special analysis.

* **The routine reports** are those issued on a regular basis; but, as we noted earlier,
regular does not necessarily refer to the calendar.
    * For senior management, the reports will usually be periodic and at major
milestones, but for the PM and lower-level project personnel, critical events may
be used to trigger routine reports.
    * At times, it may be useful to issue routine reports on resource usage periodically,
occasionally on a weekly or even daily basis.

* **Exception reports** are useful in two cases
  * First, they are directly oriented to project management decision-making
and should be distributed to the team members who will have prime
responsibility for decisions or who have a clear "need to know."
* **Special analysis reports** are used to disseminate the results Of special studies
conducted as part of the project or as a response to special problems that arise
during the project.
    * Usually, they cover matters that may be Of interest to other PMs or make use
of analytic methods that might be helpful on other projects.

## Meetings
* There is no doubt that meetings of project teams
are necessary and often helpful.
* The main complaints are that they are interminably
long, come to no conclusions, and waste everyone's
time.
* Indeed, a short commentary on how not to run a
meeting is entitled, "Creative Time Wasting"

A few simple rules can remove most of the pain associated with project meetings
1. **Use meetings for making group decisions or getting input for**
important problems.
    * Avoid "show-and-tell" meetings, sometimes called "status
and review meetings."
    * If the latter type of meeting has been used to keep project
team members informed about what others are doing on
the project, insist that such information be communicated
personally or electronically by the relevant individuals to the
relevant individuals

2. **Have preset starting and stopping times as well as a
written agenda.**
    * Stick with both, and above all, do not penalize
those who show up on time by making them wait
for those who are tardy
3. **Make sure that you (and others) do your homework
prior to the meeting. Be prepared!**

4. **If you chair the meeting, take your own minutes.**
    * Reality (and the minutes become reality as soon as the
meeting is over) is too important to be left to the most
junior person present.
    * Distribute the minutes as soon as possible after the
meeting, no later than the next workday

5. **Avoid attributing remarks or viewpoints to individuals
in the minutes.**
    * Attribution makes people quite wary about what they
say in meetings and damps creativity as well as controversy

6. **Avoid overly formal rules of procedure**
A project meeting is not a parliament and is not the place for Robert's Rules of Order, though courtesy is always in order

7. **If a serious problem or crisis arises, call a meeting for
the purpose of dealing with that issue only.**
    * The stopping time for such meetings may be "When
the problem has been solved." Some types of
meetings should never be held at all.

## Common Reporting Problems
* There are three common difficulties in the design Of
project reports.
there is usually too much detail, both in the
* **First,**
reports themselves and in the input being solicited
from workers.
* Unnecessary detail (or too frequent reporting) usually
results in the reports not being read.
* In addition, it prevents project team members from
finding the information they need.
* Furthermore, the demand for large quantities of
highly detailed input information Often results in
careless preparation of the data, thereby casting
doubt on the validity of reports based on such data

* A **second** major problem is the poor interface
between the project information system and the
parent firm's information system.
* In our experience, the PM may try to force a
connection.
* It rarely works well. The parent organization's
information system must serve as the definitional
prototype for the project's information system.
* Obviously, different types of reports must be
constructed for managing the project, but they can
be built by using standard data, for the most part.
* The PM can feel free to add new kinds of data to the
information base but cannot insist that costs,
resource usage, and the like be reported in the
project differently from how they are reported in the
parent organization.
* The **third problem** concerns a poor correspondence
between the planning and the monitoring systems.
* If the monitoring system is not tracking information
directly related to the project's plans, control is
meaningless.
* This often happens when the firm's existing information
system is used for monitoring without modifications
specifically designed for project management.
* For example, an existing cost tracking system oriented
to shop operations would be inappropriate for a
project with major activities in the area of research
and development.
* But as we just noted, the. PM's problem is to fit
standard information into a reporting and tracking
system that is appropriate for the project
