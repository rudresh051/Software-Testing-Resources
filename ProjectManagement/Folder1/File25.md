## Resource Allocation

* A shortcoming of the scheduling is that they do not
address the issues of resource utilization and
availability.
* The focus is on time rather than physical resources.
* Also, it will not be sufficient to refer to resource
usage simply as "costs."
* Instead, we must refer to individual types of labor,
specific facilities, kinds of materials, individual
pieces of equipment, and other discrete inputs
that are relevant to an individual project but are
limited in availability
* In addition, we commonly must consider two types of resources:
    * (1) those that are needed in a specific amount for an activity (e.g., 2 machine
hours, 5 yards of cement, 12 labor days)
    * (2) those that are needed to accompany the labor for as long as the labor is
used, such as a machine.
