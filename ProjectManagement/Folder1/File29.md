Updating a Project's Earned Value  

## Earned value analysis
* We have covered monitoring for parts of projects.
* Monitoring performance for the entire project is also
crucial because performance is the **"reason for being"**
of the project.
* Individual task performance must be monitored
carefully because the timing and coordination between
tasks are essential.
* But overall project performance is the crux of the matter and must not be
overlooked.
* One way of **measuring overall performance is by using an aggregate performance measure called earned value (EV).**

## Earned value chart and calculations
* A serious difficulty with comparing actual expenditures against budgeted or baseline expenditures for any given time period is that the comparison fails to take into account the **amount of work accomplished** relative to the
cost incurred.
* The earned value of work performed (value completed) for those tasks in progress is **found by multiplying the estimated percentage of physical completion of work for each task by the planned cost for those tasks.**
* Earned value = % of Physical completion of work x Planned cost
* The result is the amount that should have been spent on the task so far.
* This can then be compared with the actual amount spent.
* Making an overall estimate of the per cent completion of a project
without **careful study of each of its tasks and work units** is not sensible—
though some people make such estimates, even so.
* Instead, it is apparent that at any date during the life of a project, the
following general condition exists:
    * Some work units **have been finished and are 100 per cent complete.**  
    * Some work units have **not started yet** and are **0% complete.**  
    * Other units **have been started but are not yet finished,** and we may
estimate a **per cent completion** for this latter group

### Estimating 'Percent Calculation'
* As we said, estimating the **"per cent completion"** of each task (or work
package) **is nontrivial.**
* If the task is to write a piece of software, per cent completion can be
estimated as the number of lines of code written divided by the total
number of lines to be written—given that the latter has been estimated.
* But what if the task is to test the software?
* We have run a known number of tests, but how many remain to be run?

There are several conventions used to aid in estimating percent completion  
**The 50-50 rule**  
1. 50% - Fifty per cent completion is assumed when
the task is begun, and the remaining 50 per
cent when the work is complete.
2. 50% - This seems to be the most popular rule,
probably because it is relatively fair and
doesn't require the effort of attempting to
estimate task progress.
