## Flag an Issue

```
In Jira, flags (or flags, depending on the context) are often used to 
indicate specific statuses or conditions related to a ticket. The use of 
flags can vary depending on the organization's workflow and conventions, 
but here are some common uses:
1. Attention Needed: Flags can be used to signal that a ticket requires 
special attention, perhaps because it's overdue, has dependencies, or needs 
review.
2. Visual Organization: Flags help visually organize and categorize 
tickets, making it easier for team members to quickly identify important 
information about a ticket at a glance.
3. Custom Indicators: Flags can be used as custom indicators to represent any 
meaningful distinction within the workflow. For instance, a flag might indicate 
a specific type of issue, a customer request, a bug, a feature request, etc.
```

You can flag an issue to indicate that it's important or blocked.   
The card of a flagged issue is displayed in yellow in the Scrum backlog,   
Active sprints of a Scrum board, Kanban backlog (if enabled), and Kanban board.

**To flag an issue:**
1. Go to your board or backlog.
2. Select an issue and select `...` > **Add flag.**

* You can also add a comment when you're adding a flag to or removing   
a flag from an issue. You may want to do this to indicate your reason   
for adding or removing the flag. 

* Flagged issues are visible to all members of a project.

```
Overall, flags in Jira serve as a versatile tool for communication, 
organization, and workflow management within a project or team.
