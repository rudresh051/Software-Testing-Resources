## Difference between Kanban and Scrum

### Explanation 1
```
Imagine you're building a tower with blocks. With Scrum, you work on building the 
tower for a short time, then you take a break and plan how to build the next part. 
It's like building the tower block by block with breaks in between to make a plan. 
But with Kanban, you just keep adding blocks to the tower one by one without stopping 
to make a new plan. It's like building the tower continuously without breaks.
```

### Explanation 2
```
Think of Scrum like a series of short races where a team builds something 
(let's say a car) in each race. Before each race, they plan how to build a part 
of the car, like the wheels or the engine. Then, they work really hard to finish 
that part during the race. After the race, they take a break to plan for the next 
part. It's organized and structured, with clear goals for each race.

On the other hand, Kanban is more like a continuous flow. Imagine a factory where 
cars are being assembled on an assembly line. There's no set race or pause for planning. 
Workers just keep adding parts to the cars as they move along the line. It's a steady 
pace without distinct races or breaks, but the work keeps moving forward."

In essence, Scrum works in short, focused bursts with breaks for planning, while Kanban is a continuous flow without distinct pauses for planning.

| Aspect         | Kanban                                                     | Scrum                                                       |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Methodology**| Lean methodology, focuses on continuous delivery           | Agile framework, emphasizes iterative development            |
| **Workflow**   | Visualizes workflow stages, often represented on a board   | Sprints with fixed time intervals (e.g., 2 weeks)            |
| **Planning**   | Continuous flow, no predefined timeboxed planning meetings | Sprint planning meetings at the start of each sprint         |
| **Roles**      | No predefined roles, team members may have various roles   | Defined roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team |
| **Iterations** | No fixed iterations, work items move through stages       | Fixed-length iterations (sprints) with defined goals         |
| **Prioritization** | Prioritizes work based on immediate needs                | Backlog prioritization during sprint planning meetings        |
| **Meetings**   | Daily stand-up meetings for status updates and blockers    | Daily Scrum meetings, Sprint Planning, Review, Retrospective|
| **Metrics**    | Cycle time, throughput, work in progress (WIP) limits     | Velocity, burndown charts, sprint backlog progress           |
| **Flexibility**| Highly flexible, allows for changes at any time            | Structured framework with less flexibility for changes       |
