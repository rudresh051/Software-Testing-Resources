# Advanced Search in Jira Cloud

The advanced search allows you to build structured queries using the Jira Query Language (JQL) to search for work items. You can specify criteria that you can't define in the quick or basic searches. For example, you can use the ORDER BY clause in JQL when youâ€™re searching for work items. JQL can help gain key project insights and help you find not just work items but also important information in projects.
