# Confluence in Jira

### 🧩 **What is Confluence?**

**Confluence** is a **collaboration and documentation tool** made by Atlassian — the same company that makes **Jira**.

You can think of it as your team’s **knowledge base** or **wiki**, where you can:

* Write project documentation
* Create meeting notes
* Maintain process guidelines
* Track decisions
* Share design documents, test cases, or reports

Basically, **Confluence = Team Workspace for Documentation**
Whereas **Jira = Tool for Project & Issue Tracking**.

### ⚙️ **How Confluence and Jira Work Together**

The real power comes when you **integrate Confluence with Jira**.

Here’s how they connect:

| Jira                                            | Confluence                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Tracks work (tasks, bugs, stories, epics, etc.) | Documents how and why that work is done            |
| For developers, testers, and project managers   | For everyone to collaborate, write, and share info |
| Workflow-based (To Do → In Progress → Done)     | Page-based (docs, meeting notes, specs, etc.)      |

#### Example of Integration:

* In **Jira**, a story like *“Implement new login API”* can be linked to a **Confluence page** that contains:

  * The API design
  * Technical notes
  * Test plan
* From **Confluence**, you can insert a **Jira issue macro** to display real-time Jira issues directly on a documentation page.

This means:
✅ Developers can see related documentation
✅ Testers can attach test plans
✅ Managers can generate status reports automatically from Jira data

### 💡 Example Use Cases:

* **QA teams:** Document test strategies, link test cases to Jira tickets.
* **Development teams:** Maintain design docs linked to user stories.
* **HR / Management:** Maintain policies, onboarding guides, sprint retrospectives.

### 🏗️ **Hierarchy in Confluence:**

* **Spaces:** Like big folders (e.g., “QA Documentation,” “Project Alpha”).
* **Pages:** Individual documents inside spaces.
* **Child Pages:** Subtopics or detailed docs under main pages.

### 🧠 In Short:

| Tool           | Purpose                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jira**       | Tracks *what* work is being done and *who* is doing it.                     |
| **Confluence** | Explains *why* and *how* that work is done, with documentation and context. |
