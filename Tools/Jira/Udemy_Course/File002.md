# Agile Concepts
SCRUM in Agile is a **lightweight framework** used to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products.
Think of it as a structured way for teams to **collaborate, adapt, and deliver value quickly** in short cycles.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### ðŸ”‘ Key Ideas in Scrum

* **Iterative & Incremental**: Work is delivered in small, usable chunks called **sprints** (usually 2â€“4 weeks).
* **Empirical process control**: Decisions are based on what is known (transparency, inspection, adaptation).
* **Cross-functional teams**: The team has all the skills needed to deliver without depending on outsiders during the sprint.
* **Self-organizing**: Teams decide *how* to do the work, instead of being directed step by step.

### ðŸ§© Core Roles

1. **Product Owner** â†’ Defines *what* to build (manages product backlog, prioritization).
2. **Scrum Master** â†’ Facilitates the process, removes obstacles, ensures Scrum is understood and followed.
3. **Development Team** â†’ Builds the product increment during each sprint.

### ðŸ“… Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

1. **Sprint** â†’ The fixed time-box where work is done (2â€“4 weeks).
2. **Sprint Planning** â†’ Team plans what they can deliver in the sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** â†’ 15-min daily sync for progress and blockers.
4. **Sprint Review** â†’ Demonstration of what was completed; feedback from stakeholders.
5. **Sprint Retrospective** â†’ Team reflects and improves their way of working.

### ðŸ“‹ Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog** â†’ Ordered list of all desired work/features.
2. **Sprint Backlog** â†’ Selected work for the current sprint.
3. **Increment** â†’ The usable product output of a sprint (potentially shippable).

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
Scrum = *Agile in practice* â†’ a framework that helps teams **focus on delivering value frequently**, **adapt to change quickly**, and **continuously improve**.
