When deciding whether to **block** a parent card or link it as "**relates to**" in Jira, you should consider the following factors:

### 1. **Severity of the Bug:**

- **Blocker**: If the bug critically affects the parent card's core functionality or prevents it from being completed, you should consider blocking the parent card. For example:
  - If the bug causes the application or feature to crash.
  - If it stops other team members from progressing with their work.
- **Relates to**: If the bug is minor or cosmetic and does not hinder the progress of the parent card, use "relates to." For example:
  - UI alignment issues.
  - Minor usability issues that do not stop the feature from working.

### 2. **Impact on Completion:**

- **Blocker**: If the bug completely halts the development or prevents the card from being marked as "done," you should block the parent card.
- **Relates to**: If the bug can be fixed separately, without holding up the delivery of the parent task, "relates to" is more appropriate.

### 3. **Dependency on the Bug Fix:**

- **Blocker**: If the parent card is dependent on the bug being fixed for testing, implementation, or deployment, block it.
- **Relates to**: If the bug is an independent issue that can be resolved after the parent card is completed, a "relates to" link is enough.

### 4. **Timeline and Priority:**

- **Blocker**: If fixing the bug is critical for meeting deadlines, block the parent card to ensure the issue is addressed with high priority.
- **Relates to**: If the bug can be addressed in a future sprint or does not affect the overall timeline, "relates to" would be more appropriate.

### 5. **Scope of Fix:**

- **Blocker**: If fixing the bug requires substantial changes that affect the work being done in the parent card, blocking is recommended.
- **Relates to**: If the fix is isolated and does not impact the current functionality or progress, "relates to" is sufficient.

### 6. **Business Impact:**

- **Blocker**: If the bug causes major business functionality to break, and resolving it is essential for stakeholders or users, it should block the parent.
- **Relates to**: If the issue is more about enhancements or non-critical business functionality, use "relates to."

In short, block the parent card when the bug critically affects its completion or functionality. Use "relates to" when the bug is more of an enhancement or a non-critical issue that can be worked on in parallel.
