# Test Sigma

* **No Code Automation** refers to the process of automating tasks and processes  
using tools and platforms that **do not require programming or coding skills.**
* No code automation tools are designed to be **user-friendly** and **easy to use**, and  
often provide a **visual interface** that allows users to create and configure  
automation rules and workflow using drag-and-drop or point-and-click actions.  

* No code automation has several advantages

**Ease of use:** No code automation tools are designed to be easy to use, even for users who have no programming
or coding skills. This makes it possible for non-technical users to create and configure automation rules and
workflow.
**Speed:** No code automation tools can be used to quickly set up and configure automated tasks and processes,
without the need to write and test code.
**Cost-effective:** No code automation tools are often less expensive than traditional programming-based
automation tools, as they do not require specialized programming skills.
**Flexibility:** No code automation tools can be used to automate a wide range of tasks and processes, making them
a flexible and versatile solution for automating business processes and tasks.
