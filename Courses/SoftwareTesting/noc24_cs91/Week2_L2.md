## Verification, Validation and Testing
As per IEEE-STD-610,
* **Validation:** The process of evaluating software at the **end of software development** to ensure compliance with intended
usage. i.e., checking of the software meets its requirements.
* **Verification:** The process of determining whether the products of a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements established at the start of that phase.

Testing, as we will see in this course, deals mainly with verification.

## Other related areas

proving, prJgram analysis.
* Modelling and simulation.
* Accreditation.
