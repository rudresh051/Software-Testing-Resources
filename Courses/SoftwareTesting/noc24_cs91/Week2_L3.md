# Representation of graphs
* Two standard ways of representing graphs:
adjacency matrix
adjacency lists.
* Either way applies to both undirected graphs and directed
graphs.
* Adjacency list representation provides a compact way to
graphs, i.e., graphs for which IEI is much less than represent sparse than I V 12.
* Adjacency matrix represenation provides a compact way to
represent dense graphs, i.e., graphs for which IEI is close to
11/12.
