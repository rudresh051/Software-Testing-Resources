## Software in this century
### Need for testing

* Software is ubiquitous:  
Finance, telecommunication, home and building automation,  
process control, transportation, social networking, toys etc.  
* Such software should be of very high quality: offer good
performance in terms of **response time**, processing capacity
and also have **no errors.**
* It is no longer feasible to shut down a malfunctioning system in order to restore safety.
* We are dependent on systems for continuous functioning and
consequences of failure can be disastrous.
